BUDA
PESTH
SEEMS
A
WONDERFUL
PLACE
FROM
THE
GLIMPSE
WHICH
IGOT
OF
IT
FROM
THE
TRAIN
AND
THE
LITTLE
I
COULD
WALK
THROUGH
THESTREETS
I
FEARED
TO
GO
VERY
FAR
FROM
THE
STATION
AS
WE
HAD
ARRIVEDLATE
AND
WOULD
START
AS
NEAR
THE
CORRECT
TIME
AS
POSSIBLE
THEIMPRESSION
I
HAD
WAS
THAT
WE
WERE
LEAVING
THE
WEST
AND
ENTERING
THEEAST
THE
MOST
WESTERN
OF
SPLENDID
BRIDGES
OVER
THE
DANUBE
WHICH
ISHERE
OF
NOBLE
WIDTH
AND
DEPTH
TOOK
US
AMONG
THE
TRADITIONS
OF
TURKISHRULE
WE
LEFT
IN
PRETTY
GOOD
TIME
AND
CAME
AFTER
NIGHTFALL
TO
KLAUSENBURGH
HERE
I
STOPPED
FOR
THE
NIGHT
AT
THE
HOTEL
ROYALE
I
HAD
FOR
DINNER
ORRATHER
SUPPER
A
CHICKEN
DONE
UP
SOME
WAY
WITH
RED
PEPPER
WHICH
WASVERY
GOOD
BUT
THIRSTY
MEM
GET
RECIPE
FOR
MINA
I
ASKED
THEWAITER
AND
HE
SAID
IT
WAS
CALLED
PAPRIKA
HENDL
AND
THAT
AS
IT
WAS
ANATIONAL
DISH
I
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
GET
IT
ANYWHERE
ALONG
THECARPATHIANS
I
FOUND
MY
SMATTERING
OF
GERMAN
VERY
USEFUL
HERE
INDEED
IDON
T
KNOW
HOW
I
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
GET
ON
WITHOUT
IT
HAVING
HAD
SOME
TIME
AT
MY
DISPOSAL
WHEN
IN
LONDON
I
HAD
VISITED
THEBRITISH
MUSEUM
AND
MADE
SEARCH
AMONG
THE
BOOKS
AND
MAPS
IN
THE
LIBRARYREGARDING
TRANSYLVANIA
IT
HAD
STRUCK
ME
THAT
SOME
FOREKNOWLEDGE
OF
THECOUNTRY
COULD
HARDLY
FAIL
TO
HAVE
SOME
IMPORTANCE
IN
DEALING
WITH
ANOBLEMAN
OF
THAT
COUNTRY
I
FIND
THAT
THE
DISTRICT
HE
NAMED
IS
IN
THEEXTREME
EAST
OF
THE
COUNTRY
JUST
ON
THE
BORDERS
OF
THREE
STATES
TRANSYLVANIA
MOLDAVIA
AND
BUKOVINA
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
THE
CARPATHIANMOUNTAINS
ONE
OF
THE
WILDEST
AND
LEAST
KNOWN
PORTIONS
OF
EUROPE
I
WASNOT
ABLE
TO
LIGHT
ON
ANY
MAP
OR
WORK
GIVING
THE
EXACT
LOCALITY
OF
THECASTLE
DRACULA
AS
THERE
ARE
NO
MAPS
OF
THIS
COUNTRY
AS
YET
TO
COMPAREWITH
OUR
OWN
ORDNANCE
SURVEY
MAPS
BUT
I
FOUND
THAT
BISTRITZ
THE
POSTTOWN
NAMED
BY
COUNT
DRACULA
IS
A
FAIRLY
WELL
KNOWN
PLACE
I
SHALL
ENTERHERE
SOME
OF
MY
NOTES
AS
THEY
MAY
REFRESH
MY
MEMORY
WHEN
I
TALK
OVER
MYTRAVELS
WITH
MINA
IN
THE
POPULATION
OF
TRANSYLVANIA
THERE
ARE
FOUR
DISTINCT
NATIONALITIES
SAXONS
IN
THE
SOUTH
AND
MIXED
WITH
THEM
THE
WALLACHS
WHO
ARE
THEDESCENDANTS
OF
THE
DACIANS
MAGYARS
IN
THE
WEST
AND
SZEKELYS
IN
THEEAST
AND
NORTH
I
AM
GOING
AMONG
THE
LATTER
WHO
CLAIM
TO
BE
DESCENDEDFROM
ATTILA
AND
THE
HUNS
THIS
MAY
BE
SO
FOR
WHEN
THE
MAGYARS
CONQUEREDTHE
COUNTRY
IN
THE
ELEVENTH
CENTURY
THEY
FOUND
THE
HUNS
SETTLED
IN
IT
IREAD
THAT
EVERY
KNOWN
SUPERSTITION
IN
THE
WORLD
IS
GATHERED
INTO
THEHORSESHOE
OF
THE
CARPATHIANS
AS
IF
IT
WERE
THE
CENTRE
OF
SOME
SORT
OFIMAGINATIVE
WHIRLPOOL
IF
SO
MY
STAY
MAY
BE
VERY
INTERESTING
MEM
IMUST
ASK
THE
COUNT
ALL
ABOUT
THEM
I
DID
NOT
SLEEP
WELL
THOUGH
MY
BED
WAS
COMFORTABLE
ENOUGH
FOR
I
HADALL
SORTS
OF
QUEER
DREAMS
THERE
WAS
A
DOG
HOWLING
ALL
NIGHT
UNDER
MYWINDOW
WHICH
MAY
HAVE
HAD
SOMETHING
TO
DO
WITH
IT
OR
IT
MAY
HAVE
BEENTHE
PAPRIKA
FOR
I
HAD
TO
DRINK
UP
ALL
THE
WATER
IN
MY
CARAFE
AND
WASSTILL
THIRSTY
TOWARDS
MORNING
I
SLEPT
AND
WAS
WAKENED
BY
THE
CONTINUOUSKNOCKING
AT
MY
DOOR
SO
I
GUESS
I
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
SLEEPING
SOUNDLY
THEN
I
HAD
FOR
BREAKFAST
MORE
PAPRIKA
AND
A
SORT
OF
PORRIDGE
OF
MAIZE
FLOURWHICH
THEY
SAID
WAS
MAMALIGA
AND
EGG
PLANT
STUFFED
WITH
FORCEMEAT
AVERY
EXCELLENT
DISH
WHICH
THEY
CALL
IMPLETATA
MEM
GET
RECIPEFOR
THIS
ALSO
I
HAD
TO
HURRY
BREAKFAST
FOR
THE
TRAIN
STARTED
A
LITTLEBEFORE
EIGHT
OR
RATHER
IT
OUGHT
TO
HAVE
DONE
SO
FOR
AFTER
RUSHING
TOTHE
STATION
AT
I
HAD
TO
SIT
IN
THE
CARRIAGE
FOR
MORE
THAN
AN
HOURBEFORE
WE
BEGAN
TO
MOVE
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
FURTHER
EAST
YOU
GO
THEMORE
UNPUNCTUAL
ARE
THE
TRAINS
WHAT
OUGHT
THEY
TO
BE
IN
CHINA
ALL
DAY
LONG
WE
SEEMED
TO
DAWDLE
THROUGH
A
COUNTRY
WHICH
WAS
FULL
OFBEAUTY
OF
EVERY
KIND
SOMETIMES
WE
SAW
LITTLE
TOWNS
OR
CASTLES
ON
THETOP
OF
STEEP
HILLS
SUCH
AS
WE
SEE
IN
OLD
MISSALS
SOMETIMES
WE
RAN
BYRIVERS
AND
STREAMS
WHICH
SEEMED
FROM
THE
WIDE
STONY
MARGIN
ON
EACH
SIDEOF
THEM
TO
BE
SUBJECT
TO
GREAT
FLOODS
IT
TAKES
A
LOT
OF
WATER
ANDRUNNING
STRONG
TO
SWEEP
THE
OUTSIDE
EDGE
OF
A
RIVER
CLEAR
AT
EVERYSTATION
THERE
WERE
GROUPS
OF
PEOPLE
SOMETIMES
CROWDS
AND
IN
ALL
SORTSOF
ATTIRE
SOME
OF
THEM
WERE
JUST
LIKE
THE
PEASANTS
AT
HOME
OR
THOSE
ISAW
COMING
THROUGH
FRANCE
AND
GERMANY
WITH
SHORT
JACKETS
AND
ROUND
HATSAND
HOME
MADE
TROUSERS
BUT
OTHERS
WERE
VERY
PICTURESQUE
THE
WOMENLOOKED
PRETTY
EXCEPT
WHEN
YOU
GOT
NEAR
THEM
BUT
THEY
WERE
VERY
CLUMSYABOUT
THE
WAIST
THEY
HAD
ALL
FULL
WHITE
SLEEVES
OF
SOME
KIND
OR
OTHER
AND
MOST
OF
THEM
HAD
BIG
BELTS
WITH
A
LOT
OF
STRIPS
OF
SOMETHINGFLUTTERING
FROM
THEM
LIKE
THE
DRESSES
IN
A
BALLET
BUT
OF
COURSE
THEREWERE
PETTICOATS
UNDER
THEM
THE
STRANGEST
FIGURES
WE
SAW
WERE
THESLOVAKS
WHO
WERE
MORE
BARBARIAN
THAN
THE
REST
WITH
THEIR
BIG
COW
BOYHATS
GREAT
BAGGY
DIRTY
WHITE
TROUSERS
WHITE
LINEN
SHIRTS
AND
ENORMOUSHEAVY
LEATHER
BELTS
NEARLY
A
FOOT
WIDE
ALL
STUDDED
OVER
WITH
BRASSNAILS
THEY
WORE
HIGH
BOOTS
WITH
THEIR
TROUSERS
TUCKED
INTO
THEM
ANDHAD
LONG
BLACK
HAIR
AND
HEAVY
BLACK
MOUSTACHES
THEY
ARE
VERYPICTURESQUE
BUT
DO
NOT
LOOK
PREPOSSESSING
ON
THE
STAGE
THEY
WOULD
BESET
DOWN
AT
ONCE
AS
SOME
OLD
ORIENTAL
BAND
OF
BRIGANDS
THEY
ARE
HOWEVER
I
AM
TOLD
VERY
HARMLESS
AND
RATHER
WANTING
IN
NATURALSELF
ASSERTION
IT
WAS
ON
THE
DARK
SIDE
OF
TWILIGHT
WHEN
WE
GOT
TO
BISTRITZ
WHICH
IS
AVERY
INTERESTING
OLD
PLACE
BEING
PRACTICALLY
ON
THE
FRONTIER
FOR
THEBORGO
PASS
LEADS
FROM
IT
INTO
BUKOVINA
IT
HAS
HAD
A
VERY
STORMYEXISTENCE
AND
IT
CERTAINLY
SHOWS
MARKS
OF
IT
FIFTY
YEARS
AGO
A
SERIESOF
GREAT
FIRES
TOOK
PLACE
WHICH
MADE
TERRIBLE
HAVOC
ON
FIVE
SEPARATEOCCASIONS

OF
THREE

THE
CASUALTIES
OF

BEING
ASSISTED
BY
FAMINE
AND
DISEASE
COUNT
DRACULA
HAD
DIRECTED
ME
TO
GO
TO
THE
GOLDEN
KRONE

WHICH
IFOUND
TO
MY
GREAT
DELIGHT
TO
BE
THOROUGHLY
OLD

OFCOURSE
I
WANTED
TO

WASEVIDENTLY
EXPECTED
FOR
WHEN
I
GOT
NEAR

FACED
ACHEERY
LOOKING
ELDERLY

IN
THE
USUAL

WITH
LONG
DOUBLE

SAID
JONATHAN

DRACULA
MAY
I
FOUND
THAT
MY
LANDLORD
HAD
GOT
A
LETTER
FROM
THE
COUNT
DIRECTING
HIM
TO
SECURE
THE
BEST
PLACE
ON
THE
COACH
FOR
ME
BUT
ONMAKING
INQUIRIES
AS
TO
DETAILS
HE
SEEMED
SOMEWHAT
RETICENT
ANDPRETENDED
THAT
HE
COULD
NOT
UNDERSTAND
MY
GERMAN
THIS
COULD
NOT
BETRUE
BECAUSE
UP
TO
THEN
HE
HAD
UNDERSTOOD
IT
PERFECTLY
AT
LEAST
HEANSWERED
MY
QUESTIONS
EXACTLY
AS
IF
HE
DID
HE
AND
HIS
WIFE
THE
OLDLADY
WHO
HAD
RECEIVED
ME
LOOKED
AT
EACH
OTHER
IN
A
FRIGHTENED
SORT
OFWAY
HE
MUMBLED
OUT
THAT
THE
MONEY
HAD
BEEN
SENT
IN
A
LETTER
AND
THATWAS
ALL
HE
KNEW
WHEN
I
ASKED
HIM
IF
HE
KNEW
COUNT
DRACULA
AND
COULDTELL
ME
ANYTHING
OF
HIS
CASTLE
BOTH
HE
AND
HIS
WIFE
CROSSED
THEMSELVES
AND
SAYING
THAT
THEY
KNEW
NOTHING
AT
ALL
SIMPLY
REFUSED
TO
SPEAKFURTHER
IT
WAS
SO
NEAR
THE
TIME
OF
STARTING
THAT
I
HAD
NO
TIME
TO
ASKANY
ONE
ELSE
FOR
IT
WAS
ALL
VERY
MYSTERIOUS
AND
NOT
BY
ANY
MEANSCOMFORTING
JUST
BEFORE
I
WAS
LEAVING
THE
OLD
LADY
CAME
UP
TO
MY
ROOM
AND
SAID
IN
AVERY
HYSTERICAL
WAY
MUST
YOU
GO
OH
YOUNG
HERR
MUST
YOU
GO
SHE
WAS
IN
SUCH
AN
EXCITEDSTATE
THAT
SHE
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
LOST
HER
GRIP
OF
WHAT
GERMAN
SHE
KNEW
ANDMIXED
IT
ALL
UP
WITH
SOME
OTHER
LANGUAGE
WHICH
I
DID
NOT
KNOW
AT
ALL
IWAS
JUST
ABLE
TO
FOLLOW
HER
BY
ASKING
MANY
QUESTIONS
WHEN
I
TOLD
HERTHAT
I
MUST
GO
AT
ONCE
AND
THAT
I
WAS
ENGAGED
ON
IMPORTANT
BUSINESS
SHE
ASKED
AGAIN
DO
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
DAY
IT
IS
I
ANSWERED
THAT
IT
WAS
THE
FOURTH
OF
MAY
SHE
SHOOK
HER
HEAD
AS
SHE
SAID
AGAIN
OH
YES
I
KNOW
THAT
I
KNOW
THAT
BUT
DO
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
DAY
IT
IS
ONMY
SAYING
THAT

TO
SHE
WAS
IN
SUCH
EVIDENT
DISTRESS
THAT
I
TRIED
TO
COMFORT
HER
BUTWITHOUT
EFFECT
FINALLY
SHE
WENT
DOWN
ON
HER
KNEES
AND
IMPLORED
ME
NOTTO
GO
AT
LEAST
TO
WAIT
A
DAY
OR
TWO
BEFORE
STARTING
IT
WAS
ALL
VERYRIDICULOUS
BUT
I
DID
NOT
FEEL
COMFORTABLE
HOWEVER
THERE
WAS
BUSINESSTO
BE
DONE
AND
I
COULD
ALLOW
NOTHING
TO
INTERFERE
WITH
IT
I
THEREFORETRIED
TO
RAISE
HER
UP
AND
SAID
AS
GRAVELY
AS
I
COULD
THAT
I
THANKEDHER
BUT
MY
DUTY
WAS
IMPERATIVE
AND
THAT
I
MUST
GO

FROM

NECK
OFFERED

FOR
AS
AN
ENGLISH
CHURCHMAN
I
HAVE
BEENTAUGHT
TO
REGARD

THINGS
AS
IN

MEASURE
IDOLATROUS
AND
YET
ITSEEMED
SO
UNGRACIOUS
TO
REFUSE
AN
OLD
LADY
MEANING
SO
WELL
AND
IN
SUCH
ASTATE
OF
MIND
SHE
SAW
I
SUPPOSE
THE
DOUBT
IN
MY

WITH

THEY
WERE
EVIDENTLY

AND
THEN
THEY
LOOKED
AT
ME
AND

HEAR
A

WORDS
FORTHERE

TWO

WITH

I
GOT
AFELLOW

TO
TELL
ME
WHAT
THEY

HE
WOULD
NOT
ANSWER
ATFIRST
BUT
ON
LEARNING
THAT
I
WAS
ENGLISH
HE
EXPLAINED
THAT
IT
WAS
ACHARM
OR
GUARD
AGAINST

THIS
WAS
NOT
VERY
PLEASANT
FOR
ME
JUST
STARTING
FOR
AN

PLACE
TO
MEET
AN

MAN
BUT
EVERY
ONESEEMED
SO
KIND
HEARTED
AND
SO
SORROWFUL
AND
SO
SYMPATHETIC
THAT
ICOULD
NOT
BUT
BE
TOUCHED
I
SHALL
NEVER

THE
LAST
GLIMPSE
WHICH
IHAD
OF
THE

AND
ITS

OF

AS

OFRICH
FOLIAGE

CRACKED
HIS

OVER

RAN
ABREAST
AND
WE
SET
OFF
ONOUR

I
SOON
LOST
SIGHT
AND
RECOLLECTION
OF
GHOSTLY
FEARS
IN
THE

OF

AS
WE
DROVE
ALONG
ALTHOUGH

I

I
MIGHT

IN

AMONGST

URGED

THEN
THROUGH

I
COULD

A

WITH

A

AND
THAT

I
HAD
SEEN
OUTSIDE

ATBISTRITZ
THE

OF

BUT
THERE
WAS
ON

NO

THE

DREW

WITH
A

WHICH
SEEMED

I

AND
WITH

MY

THEN
I
DESCENDED

AS

WITH

WITHOUT

WESWEPT
INTO

OF

AS
I

I

BY

OF

AND
PROJECTEDAGAINST
IT
THE

OF

THENTHE

CRACKED
HIS

AND
CALLED
TO
HIS

AND
OFF
THEY
SWEPTON
THEIR
WAY
TO
BUKOVINA
AS
THEY
SANK
INTO
THE
DARKNESS
I
FELT
ASTRANGE
CHILL
AND
A
LONELY
FEELING
CAME
OVER
ME
BUT
A
CLOAK
WAS
THROWNOVER
MY
SHOULDERS
AND
A
RUG
ACROSS
MY
KNEES
AND
THE
DRIVER
SAID
INEXCELLENT
GERMAN
THE
NIGHT
IS
CHILL
MEIN
HERR
AND
MY
MASTER
THE
COUNT
BADE
ME
TAKE
ALLCARE
OF
YOU
THERE
IS
A
FLASK
OF
SLIVOVITZ
THE
PLUM
BRANDY
OF
THECOUNTRY
UNDERNEATH
THE
SEAT
IF
YOU
SHOULD
REQUIRE
IT
I
DID
NOT
TAKEANY
BUT
IT
WAS
A
COMFORT
TO
KNOW
IT
WAS
THERE
ALL
THE
SAME
I
FELT
ALITTLE
STRANGELY
AND
NOT
A
LITTLE
FRIGHTENED
I
THINK
HAD
THERE
BEENANY
ALTERNATIVE
I
SHOULD
HAVE
TAKEN
IT
INSTEAD
OF
PROSECUTING
THATUNKNOWN
NIGHT
JOURNEY
THE
CARRIAGE
WENT
AT
A
HARD
PACE
STRAIGHT
ALONG
THEN
WE
MADE
A
COMPLETE
TURN
AND
WENT
ALONG
ANOTHER
STRAIGHT
ROAD
ITSEEMED
TO
ME
THAT
WE
WERE
SIMPLY
GOING
OVER
AND
OVER
THE
SAME
GROUNDAGAIN
AND
SO
I
TOOK
NOTE
OF
SOME
SALIENT
POINT
AND
FOUND
THAT
THIS
WASSO
I
WOULD
HAVE
LIKED
TO
HAVE
ASKED
THE
DRIVER
WHAT
THIS
ALL
MEANT
BUTI
REALLY
FEARED
TO
DO
SO
FOR
I
THOUGHT
THAT
PLACED
AS
I
WAS
ANYPROTEST
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
NO
EFFECT
IN
CASE
THERE
HAD
BEEN
AN
INTENTION
TODELAY
BY
AND
BY
HOWEVER
AS
I
WAS
CURIOUS
TO
KNOW
HOW
TIME
WASPASSING
I
STRUCK
A
MATCH
AND
BY
ITS
FLAME
LOOKED
AT
MY
WATCH
IT
WASWITHIN
A
FEW
MINUTES
OF
MIDNIGHT
THIS
GAVE
ME
A
SORT
OF
SHOCK
FOR
ISUPPOSE
THE
GENERAL
SUPERSTITION
ABOUT
MIDNIGHT
WAS
INCREASED
BY
MYRECENT
EXPERIENCES
I
WAITED
WITH
A
SICK
FEELING
OF
SUSPENSE
THEN
A
DOG
BEGAN
TO
HOWL
SOMEWHERE
IN
A
FARMHOUSE
FAR
DOWN
THE
ROAD
ALONG
AGONISED
WAILING
AS
IF
FROM
FEAR
THE
SOUND
WAS
TAKEN
UP
BYANOTHER
DOG
AND
THEN
ANOTHER
AND
ANOTHER
TILL
BORNE
ON
THE
WIND
WHICHNOW
SIGHED
SOFTLY
THROUGH
THE
PASS
A
WILD
HOWLING
BEGAN
WHICH
SEEMEDTO
COME
FROM
ALL
OVER
THE

AS
FAR
AS
THE
IMAGINATION
COULD
GRASPIT
THROUGH
THE
GLOOM
OF
THE
NIGHT
AT
THE
FIRST
HOWL
THE
HORSES
BEGAN
TOSTRAIN
AND
REAR
BUT
THE
DRIVER
SPOKE
TO
THEM
SOOTHINGLY
AND
THEYQUIETED
DOWN
BUT
SHIVERED
AND
SWEATED
AS
THOUGH
AFTER
A
RUNAWAY
FROMSUDDEN
FRIGHT
THEN
FAR
OFF
IN
THE
DISTANCE
FROM
THE
MOUNTAINS
ON
EACHSIDE
OF
US
BEGAN
A
LOUDER
AND
A
SHARPER
HOWLING
THAT
OF
WOLVES
WHICHAFFECTED
BOTH
THE
HORSES
AND
MYSELF
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
FOR
I
WAS
MINDED
TOJUMP
FROM
THE
CALECHE
AND
RUN
WHILST
THEY
REARED
AGAIN
AND
PLUNGEDMADLY
SO
THAT
THE
DRIVER
HAD
TO
USE
ALL
HIS
GREAT
STRENGTH
TO
KEEP
THEMFROM
BOLTING
IN
A
FEW
MINUTES
HOWEVER
MY
OWN
EARS
GOT
ACCUSTOMED
TOTHE
SOUND
AND
THE
HORSES
SO
FAR
BECAME
QUIET
THAT
THE

WAS
ABLETO
DESCEND
AND
TO
STAND
BEFORE
THEM
HE
PETTED
AND
SOOTHED
THEM
ANDWHISPERED
SOMETHING
IN
THEIR

AS
I
HAVE
HEARD

FROM

DREADFULLY

MY

THE

HOWEVER
WAS
NOT

DISTURBED
HE
KEPT
TURNING
HIS

RIGHT
BUT
I
COULD
NOT

THROUGH

SUDDENLY
AWAY
ON

I
SAW
A
FAINT
FLICKERING
BLUE
FLAME
THEDRIVER
SAW
IT
AT
THE

MOMENT
HE
AT

CHECKED
THE
HORSES
AND
JUMPING
TO
THE

DISAPPEARED
INTO
THE

I
DID
NOT

TO

THE

AS
THE
HOWLING
OF
THE

GREW

BUT
WHILEI
WONDERED
THE

SUDDENLY
APPEARED
AGAIN
AND
WITHOUT

TOOKHIS

AND
WE
RESUMED
OUR

I
MUST

OF
THE

FOR
IT
SEEMED
TO
BE
REPEATEDENDLESSLY
AND
NOW
LOOKING
BACK
IT
IS
LIKE
A
SORT
OF
AWFUL
NIGHTMARE
ONCE
THE
FLAME
APPEARED
SO
NEAR
THE
ROAD
THAT
EVEN
IN
THE
DARKNESSAROUND
US
I
COULD
WATCH
THE
DRIVER
S
MOTIONS
HE
WENT
RAPIDLY
TO
WHERETHE
BLUE

AROSE
IT
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
VERY
FAINT
FOR
IT
DID

ILLUMINE
THE
PLACE
AROUND
IT
AT

AND
GATHERING
A
FEW
STONES
FORMED
THEM
INTO
SOME

ONCE
THERE
APPEARED
A
STRANGE
OPTICALEFFECT
WHEN
HE
STOOD
BETWEEN
ME
AND
THE
FLAME
HE
DID
NOT
OBSTRUCT
IT
FOR
I
COULD
SEE
ITS
GHOSTLY
FLICKER
ALL
THE
SAME
THIS
STARTLED
ME
BUTAS
THE
EFFECT
WAS
ONLY
MOMENTARY
I
TOOK
IT
THAT
MY
EYES
DECEIVED
MESTRAINING
THROUGH
THE
DARKNESS
THEN
FOR
A
TIME
THERE
WERE
NO
BLUEFLAMES
AND
WE
SPED
ONWARDS
THROUGH
THE
GLOOM
WITH
THE
HOWLING
OF
THEWOLVES
AROUND
US
AS
THOUGH
THEY
WERE
FOLLOWING
IN
A
MOVING
CIRCLE
AT

THERE
CAME
A
TIME
WHEN
THE
DRIVER
WENT
FURTHER
AFIELD
THAN
HEHAD
YET
GONE
AND
DURING
HIS
ABSENCE
THE
HORSES
BEGAN
TO
TREMBLE
WORSETHAN
EVER
AND
TO
SNORT
AND
SCREAM
WITH
FRIGHT
I
COULD
NOT
SEE
ANY
CAUSEFOR
IT
FOR
THE
HOWLING
OF
THE
WOLVES
HAD
CEASED
ALTOGETHER
BUT
JUSTTHEN
THE
MOON
SAILING
THROUGH
THE
BLACK
CLOUDS
APPEARED
BEHIND
THEJAGGED
CREST
OF
A
BEETLING
PINE
CLAD
ROCK
AND
BY
ITS
LIGHT
I
SAWAROUND
US
A
RING
OF
WOLVES
WITH
WHITE
TEETH
AND
LOLLING
RED
TONGUES
WITH
LONG
SINEWY
LIMBS
AND
SHAGGY
HAIR
THEY
WERE
A
HUNDRED
TIMES
MORETERRIBLE
IN
THE
GRIM
SILENCE
WHICH
HELD
THEM
THAN
EVEN
WHEN
THEY
HOWLED
FOR
MYSELF
I
FELT
A
SORT
OF
PARALYSIS
OF
FEAR
IT
IS
ONLY
WHEN
A
MANFEELS
HIMSELF

WITH
SUCH
HORRORS
THAT
HE
CAN
UNDERSTANDTHEIR
TRUE
IMPORT
ALL
AT

HAD
HADSOME
PECULIAR

ANDLOOKED
HELPLESSLY

PAINFUL
TO

BUT
THE
LIVING
RING
OF
TERROR
ENCOMPASSED
THEM
ON
EVERY

AND
THEYHAD
PERFORCE
TO
REMAIN
WITHIN
IT
I
CALLED
TO
THE
COACHMAN
TO
COME
FORIT
SEEMED
TO
ME
THAT
OUR
ONLY
CHANCE
WAS
TO
TRY
TO
BREAK
OUT
THROUGH
THERING
AND
TO
AID
HIS

I
SHOUTED
AND
BEAT
THE
SIDE
OF
THECALECHE
HOPING
BY
THE
NOISE
TO
SCARE
THE
WOLVES
FROM
THAT
SIDE
SO
ASTO
GIVE
HIM
A
CHANCE
OF
REACHING
THE
TRAP
HOW
HE
CAME
THERE
I
KNOWNOT
BUT
I
HEARD
HIS
VOICE
RAISED
IN
A
TONE
OF
IMPERIOUS
COMMAND
ANDLOOKING
TOWARDS
THE
SOUND
SAW
HIM
STAND
IN
THE

AS

THIS
WAS
ALL
SO
STRANGE
AND

TO
ME
I
COULD
NOT
BUT
NOTICE
THAT
THEY
WERE
RATHERCOARSE
BROAD
WITH
SQUAT
FINGERS
STRANGE
TO
SAY
THERE
WERE
HAIRS
INTHE
CENTRE
OF
THE
PALM
THE
NAILS
WERE
LONG
AND
FINE
AND
CUT
TO
A
SHARPPOINT
AS
THE
COUNT
LEANED
OVER
ME
AND
HIS
HANDS
TOUCHED
ME
I
COULD
NOTREPRESS
A
SHUDDER
IT
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
THAT
HIS
BREATH
WAS
RANK
BUT
AHORRIBLE
FEELING
OF
NAUSEA
CAME
OVER
ME
WHICH
DO
WHAT
I
WOULD
I
COULDNOT
CONCEAL
THE
COUNT
EVIDENTLY
NOTICING
IT
DREW
BACK
AND
WITH
AGRIM
SORT
OF
SMILE
WHICH
SHOWED
MORE
THAN
HE
HAD
YET
DONE
HISPROTUBERANT
TEETH
SAT
HIMSELF
DOWN
AGAIN
ON
HIS
OWN
SIDE
OF
THEFIREPLACE
WE
WERE
BOTH
SILENT
FOR
A
WHILE
AND
AS
I
LOOKED
TOWARDS
THEWINDOW
I
SAW
THE
FIRST
DIM
STREAK
OF
THE
COMING
DAWN
THERE
SEEMED
ASTRANGE
STILLNESS
OVER
EVERYTHING
BUT
AS
I
LISTENED
I
HEARD
AS
IF
FROMDOWN
BELOW
IN
THE
VALLEY
THE
HOWLING
OF
MANY
WOLVES
THE
COUNT
S
EYESGLEAMED
AND
HE
SAID
LISTEN
TO
THEM
THE
CHILDREN
OF
THE
NIGHT
WHAT
MUSIC
THEY
MAKE
SEEING
I
SUPPOSE
SOME
EXPRESSION
IN
MY
FACE
STRANGE
TO
HIM
HEADDED
AH
SIR
YOU
DWELLERS
IN
THE
CITY
CANNOT
ENTER
INTO
THE
FEELINGS
OF
THEHUNTER
THEN
HE
ROSE
AND
SAID
BUT
YOU
MUST
BE
TIRED
YOUR
BEDROOM
IS
ALL
READY
AND
TO
MORROW
YOUSHALL
SLEEP
AS
LATE
AS
YOU
WILL
I
HAVE
TO
BE
AWAY
TILL
THE
AFTERNOON
SO
SLEEP
WELL
AND
DREAM
WELL
WITH
A
COURTEOUS
BOW
HE
OPENED
FOR
MEHIMSELF
THE
DOOR
TO
THE
OCTAGONAL
ROOM
AND
I
ENTERED
MY
BEDROOM
I
AM
ALL
IN
A
SEA
OF
WONDERS
I
DOUBT
I
FEAR
I
THINK
STRANGE
THINGS
WHICH
I
DARE
NOT
CONFESS
TO
MY
OWN
SOUL
GOD
KEEP
ME
IF
ONLY
FOR
THESAKE
OF
THOSE
DEAR
TO
ME
MAY
IT
IS
AGAIN
EARLY
MORNING
BUT
I
HAVE
RESTED
AND
ENJOYED
THELAST
TWENTY
FOUR
HOURS
I
SLEPT
TILL
LATE
IN
THE
DAY
AND
AWOKE
OF
MYOWN
ACCORD
WHEN
I
HAD
DRESSED
MYSELF
I
WENT
INTO
THE
ROOM
WHERE
WE
HADSUPPED
AND
FOUND
A
COLD
BREAKFAST
LAID
OUT
WITH
COFFEE
KEPT
HOT
BY
THEPOT
BEING
PLACED
ON
THE
HEARTH
THERE
WAS
A
CARD
ON
THE
TABLE
ON
WHICHWAS
WRITTEN
I
HAVE
TO
BE
ABSENT
FOR
A
WHILE
DO
NOT
WAIT
FOR
ME
D
I
SET
TO
ANDENJOYED
A
HEARTY
MEAL
WHEN
I
HAD
DONE
I
LOOKED
FOR
A
BELL
SO
THAT
IMIGHT
LET
THE
SERVANTS
KNOW
I
HAD
FINISHED
BUT
I
COULD
NOT
FIND
ONE
THERE
ARE
CERTAINLY
ODD
DEFICIENCIES
IN
THE
HOUSE
CONSIDERING
THEEXTRAORDINARY
EVIDENCES
OF
WEALTH
WHICH
ARE
ROUND
ME
THE
TABLE
SERVICEIS
OF
GOLD
AND
SO
BEAUTIFULLY
WROUGHT
THAT
IT
MUST
BE
OF
IMMENSE
VALUE
THE
CURTAINS
AND
UPHOLSTERY
OF
THE
CHAIRS
AND
SOFAS
AND
THE
HANGINGS
OFMY
BED
ARE
OF
THE
COSTLIEST
AND
MOST
BEAUTIFUL
FABRICS
AND
MUST
HAVEBEEN
OF
FABULOUS
VALUE
WHEN
THEY
WERE
MADE
FOR
THEY
ARE
CENTURIES
OLD
THOUGH
IN
EXCELLENT
ORDER
I
SAW
SOMETHING
LIKE
THEM
IN
HAMPTON
COURT
BUT
THERE
THEY
WERE
WORN
AND
FRAYED
AND
MOTH
EATEN
BUT
STILL
IN
NONE
OFTHE
ROOMS
IS
THERE
A
MIRROR
THERE
IS
NOT
EVEN
A
TOILET
GLASS
ON
MYTABLE
AND
I
HAD
TO
GET
THE
LITTLE
SHAVING
GLASS
FROM
MY
BAG
BEFORE
ICOULD
EITHER
SHAVE
OR
BRUSH
MY
HAIR
I
HAVE
NOT
YET
SEEN
A
SERVANTANYWHERE
OR
HEARD
A
SOUND
NEAR
THE
CASTLE
EXCEPT
THE
HOWLING
OF
WOLVES
SOME
TIME
AFTER
I
HAD
FINISHED
MY
MEAL
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHETHER
TO
CALL
ITBREAKFAST
OR
DINNER
FOR
IT
WAS
BETWEEN
FIVE
AND
SIX
O
CLOCK
WHEN
I
HADIT
I
LOOKED
ABOUT
FOR
SOMETHING
TO
READ
FOR
I
DID
NOT
LIKE
TO
GO
ABOUTTHE
CASTLE
UNTIL
I
HAD
ASKED
THE
COUNT
S
PERMISSION
THERE
WASABSOLUTELY
NOTHING
IN
THE
ROOM
BOOK

OR
EVEN

SO
I
OPENED
ANOTHER
DOOR
IN
THE
ROOM
AND
FOUND
A
SORT
OFLIBRARY
THE
DOOR
OPPOSITE
MINE
I
TRIED
BUT
FOUND
IT
LOCKED
IN
THE
LIBRARY
I
FOUND
TO
MY
GREAT
DELIGHT
A
VAST
NUMBER
OF
ENGLISHBOOKS
WHOLE
SHELVES
FULL
OF
THEM
AND
BOUND
VOLUMES
OF
MAGAZINES
ANDNEWSPAPERS
A
TABLE
IN
THE
CENTRE
WAS
LITTERED
WITH

MAGAZINESAND
NEWSPAPERS
THOUGH
NONE
OF
THEM
WERE
OF
VERY
RECENT

BUT
YOU

I
KNOW
FORGIVE
ONE
WHO
HAS
SO
MANYIMPORTANT
AFFAIRS
IN
HAND
OF
COURSE
I
SAID
ALL
I
COULD
ABOUT
BEING
WILLING
AND
ASKED
IF
I
MIGHTCOME
INTO
THAT
ROOM
WHEN
I
CHOSE
HE
ANSWERED
YES
CERTAINLY
ANDADDED
YOU
MAY
GO
ANYWHERE
YOU
WISH
IN
THE
CASTLE
EXCEPT
WHERE
THE
DOORS
ARELOCKED
WHERE
OF
COURSE
YOU
WILL
NOT
WISH
TO
GO
THERE
IS
REASON
THATALL
THINGS
ARE
AS
THEY
ARE
AND
DID
YOU
SEE
WITH
MY
EYES
AND
KNOW
WITHMY
KNOWLEDGE
YOU
WOULD
PERHAPS
BETTER
UNDERSTAND
I
SAID
I
WAS
SURE
OFTHIS
AND
THEN
HE
WENT
ON
WE
ARE
IN
TRANSYLVANIA
AND
TRANSYLVANIA
IS
NOT
ENGLAND
OUR
WAYS
ARENOT
YOUR
WAYS
AND
THERE
SHALL
BE
TO
YOU
MANY
STRANGE
THINGS
NAY
FROMWHAT
YOU
HAVE
TOLD
ME
OF
YOUR
EXPERIENCES
ALREADY
YOU
KNOW
SOMETHING
OFWHAT
STRANGE
THINGS
THERE
MAY
BE
THIS
LED
TO
MUCH
CONVERSATION
AND
AS
IT
WAS
EVIDENT
THAT
HE
WANTED
TOTALK
IF
ONLY
FOR
TALKING
S
SAKE
I
ASKED
HIM
MANY
QUESTIONS
REGARDINGTHINGS
THAT
HAD
ALREADY
HAPPENED
TO
ME
OR
COME
WITHIN
MY
NOTICE
SOMETIMES
HE
SHEERED
OFF
THE
SUBJECT
OR
TURNED
THE
CONVERSATION
BYPRETENDING
NOT
TO
UNDERSTAND
BUT
GENERALLY
HE
ANSWERED
ALL
I
ASKED
MOSTFRANKLY
THEN
AS
TIME
WENT
ON
AND
I
HAD
GOT
SOMEWHAT
BOLDER
I
ASKEDHIM
OF
SOME
OF
THE
STRANGE
THINGS
OF
THE
PRECEDING
NIGHT
AS
FORINSTANCE
WHY
THE
COACHMAN
WENT
TO
THE
PLACES
WHERE
HE
HAD
SEEN
THE
BLUEFLAMES
HE
THEN
EXPLAINED
TO
ME
THAT
IT
WAS
COMMONLY
BELIEVED
THAT
ON
ACERTAIN
NIGHT
OF
THE
YEAR
LAST
NIGHT
IN
FACT
WHEN
ALL
EVIL
SPIRITSARE
SUPPOSED
TO
HAVE
UNCHECKED
SWAY
A
BLUE
FLAME
IS
SEEN
OVER
ANY
PLACEWHERE
TREASURE
HAS
BEEN
CONCEALED
THAT
TREASURE
HAS
BEEN
HIDDEN
HEWENT
ON
IN
THE
REGION
THROUGH
WHICH
YOU
CAME
LAST
NIGHT
THERE
CAN
BEBUT
LITTLE
DOUBT
FOR
IT
WAS
THE
GROUND
FOUGHT
OVER
FOR
CENTURIES
BY
THEWALLACHIAN
THE
SAXON
AND
THE
TURK
WHY
THERE
IS
HARDLY
A
FOOT
OF
SOILIN
ALL
THIS
REGION
THAT
HAS
NOT
BEEN
ENRICHED
BY
THE
BLOOD
OF
MEN
PATRIOTS
OR
INVADERS
IN
OLD
DAYS
THERE
WERE
STIRRING
TIMES
WHEN
THEAUSTRIAN
AND
THE
HUNGARIAN
CAME
UP
IN
HORDES
AND
THE
PATRIOTS
WENT
OUTTO
MEET
THEM
MEN
AND
WOMEN
THE
AGED
AND
THE
CHILDREN
TOO
AND
WAITEDTHEIR
COMING
ON
THE
ROCKS
ABOVE
THE
PASSES
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
SWEEPDESTRUCTION
ON
THEM
WITH
THEIR
ARTIFICIAL
AVALANCHES
WHEN
THE
INVADERWAS
TRIUMPHANT
HE
FOUND
BUT
LITTLE
FOR
WHATEVER
THERE
WAS
HAD
BEENSHELTERED
IN
THE
FRIENDLY
SOIL
BUT
HOW
SAID
I
CAN
IT
HAVE
REMAINED
SO
LONG
UNDISCOVERED
WHENTHERE
IS
A
SURE
INDEX
TO
IT
IF
MEN
WILL
BUT
TAKE
THE
TROUBLE
TO
LOOK
THE
COUNT
SMILED
AND
AS
HIS
LIPS
RAN
BACK
OVER
HIS
GUMS
THE
LONG
SHARP
CANINE
TEETH
SHOWED
OUT
STRANGELY
HE
ANSWERED
BECAUSE
YOUR
PEASANT
IS
AT
HEART
A
COWARD
AND
A
FOOL
THOSE
FLAMES
ONLYAPPEAR
ON
ONE
NIGHT
AND
ON
THAT
NIGHT
NO
MAN
OF
THIS
LAND
WILL
IF
HECAN
HELP
IT
STIR
WITHOUT
HIS
DOORS
AND
DEAR
SIR
EVEN
IF
HE
DID
HEWOULD
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
TO
DO
WHY
EVEN
THE
PEASANT
THAT
YOU
TELL
ME
OF
WHOMARKED
THE
PLACE
OF
THE
FLAME
WOULD
NOT
KNOW
WHERE
TO
LOOK
IN
DAYLIGHTEVEN
FOR
HIS
OWN
WORK
EVEN
YOU
WOULD
NOT
I
DARE
BE
SWORN
BE
ABLE
TOFIND
THESE
PLACES
AGAIN
THERE
YOU
ARE
RIGHT
I
SAID
I
KNOW
NO
MORE
THAN
THE
DEAD
WHERE
EVENTO
LOOK
FOR
THEM
THEN
WE
DRIFTED
INTO
OTHER
MATTERS
COME
HE
SAID
AT
LAST
TELL
ME
OF
LONDON
AND
OF
THE
HOUSE
WHICH
YOUHAVE
PROCURED
FOR
ME
WITH
AN
APOLOGY
FOR
MY
REMISSNESS
I
WENT
INTO
MYOWN
ROOM
TO
GET
THE
PAPERS
FROM
MY
BAG
WHILST
I
WAS
PLACING
THEM
INORDER
I
HEARD
A
RATTLING
OF
CHINA
AND
SILVER
IN
THE
NEXT
ROOM
AND
AS
IPASSED
THROUGH
NOTICED
THAT
THE
TABLE
HAD
BEEN
CLEARED
AND
THE
LAMPLIT
FOR
IT
WAS
BY
THIS
TIME
DEEP
INTO
THE
DARK
THE
LAMPS
WERE
ALSO
LITIN
THE
STUDY
OR
LIBRARY
AND
I
FOUND
THE
COUNT
LYING
ON
THE
SOFA
READING
OF
ALL
THINGS
IN
THE
WORLD
AN
ENGLISH
BRADSHAW
S
GUIDE
WHEN
ICAME
IN
HE
CLEARED
THE
BOOKS
AND
PAPERS
FROM
THE
TABLE
AND
WITH
HIM
IWENT
INTO
PLANS
AND
DEEDS
AND
FIGURES
OF
ALL
SORTS
HE
WAS
INTERESTED
INEVERYTHING
AND
ASKED
ME
A
MYRIAD
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
THE
PLACE
AND
ITSSURROUNDINGS
HE
CLEARLY
HAD
STUDIED
BEFOREHAND
ALL
HE
COULD
GET
ON
THESUBJECT
OF
THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD
FOR
HE
EVIDENTLY
AT
THE
END
KNEW
VERY
MUCHMORE
THAN
I
DID
WHEN
I
REMARKED
THIS
HE
ANSWERED
WELL
BUT
MY
FRIEND
IS
IT
NOT
NEEDFUL
THAT
I
SHOULD
WHEN
I
GO
THEREI
SHALL
BE
ALL
ALONE
AND
MY
FRIEND
HARKER
JONATHAN
NAY
PARDON
ME
IFALL
INTO
MY
COUNTRY
S
HABIT
OF
PUTTING
YOUR
PATRONYMIC
FIRST
MY
FRIENDJONATHAN
HARKER
WILL
NOT
BE
BY
MY
SIDE
TO
CORRECT
AND
AID
ME
HE
WILL
BEIN
EXETER
MILES
AWAY
PROBABLY
WORKING
AT
PAPERS
OF
THE
LAW
WITH
MYOTHER
FRIEND
PETER
HAWKINS
SO
WE
WENT
THOROUGHLY
INTO
THE
BUSINESS
OF
THE
PURCHASE
OF
THE
ESTATE
ATPURFLEET
WHEN
I
HAD
TOLD
HIM
THE
FACTS
AND
GOT
HIS
SIGNATURE
TO
THENECESSARY
PAPERS
AND
HAD
WRITTEN
A
LETTER
WITH
THEM
READY
TO
POST
TOMR
HAWKINS
HE
BEGAN
TO
ASK
ME
HOW
I
HAD
COME
ACROSS
SO
SUITABLE
APLACE
I
READ
TO
HIM
THE
NOTES
WHICH
I
HAD
MADE
AT
THE
TIME
AND
WHICH
IINSCRIBE
HERE
AT
PURFLEET
ON
A
BY
ROAD
I
CAME
ACROSS
JUST
SUCH
A
PLACE
AS
SEEMED
TOBE
REQUIRED
AND
WHERE
WAS
DISPLAYED
A
DILAPIDATED
NOTICE
THAT
THE
PLACEWAS
FOR
SALE
IT
IS
SURROUNDED
BY
A
HIGH
WALL
OF
ANCIENT
STRUCTURE
BUILT
OF
HEAVY
STONES
AND
HAS
NOT
BEEN
REPAIRED
FOR
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OFYEARS
THE
CLOSED
GATES
ARE
OF
HEAVY
OLD
OAK
AND
IRON
ALL
EATEN
WITHRUST
THE
ESTATE
IS
CALLED
CARFAX
NO
DOUBT
A
CORRUPTION
OF
THE
OLD
QUATREFACE
AS
THE
HOUSE
IS
FOUR
SIDED
AGREEING
WITH
THE
CARDINAL
POINTS
OFTHE
COMPASS
IT
CONTAINS
IN
ALL
SOME
TWENTY
ACRES
QUITE
SURROUNDED
BYTHE
SOLID
STONE
WALL
ABOVE
MENTIONED
THERE
ARE
MANY
TREES
ON
IT
WHICHMAKE
IT
IN
PLACES
GLOOMY
AND
THERE
IS
A
DEEP
DARK
LOOKING
POND
ORSMALL
LAKE
EVIDENTLY
FED
BY
SOME
SPRINGS
AS
THE
WATER
IS
CLEAR
ANDFLOWS
AWAY
IN
A
FAIR
SIZED
STREAM
THE
HOUSE
IS
VERY
LARGE
AND
OF
ALLPERIODS
BACK
I
SHOULD
SAY
TO
MEDIAEVAL
TIMES
FOR
ONE
PART
IS
OF
STONEIMMENSELY
THICK
WITH
ONLY
A
FEW
WINDOWS
HIGH
UP
AND
HEAVILY
BARRED
WITHIRON
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
PART
OF
A
KEEP
AND
IS
CLOSE
TO
AN
OLD
CHAPEL
ORCHURCH
I
COULD
NOT
ENTER
IT
AS
I
HAD
NOT
THE
KEY
OF
THE
DOOR
LEADINGTO
IT
FROM
THE
HOUSE
BUT
I
HAVE
TAKEN
WITH
MY
KODAK
VIEWS
OF
IT
FROMVARIOUS
POINTS
THE
HOUSE
HAS
BEEN
ADDED
TO
BUT
IN
A
VERY
STRAGGLINGWAY
AND
I
CAN
ONLY
GUESS
AT
THE
AMOUNT
OF
GROUND
IT
COVERS
WHICH
MUSTBE
VERY
GREAT
THERE
ARE
BUT
FEW
HOUSES
CLOSE
AT
HAND
ONE
BEING
A
VERYLARGE
HOUSE
ONLY
RECENTLY
ADDED
TO
AND
FORMED
INTO
A
PRIVATE
LUNATICASYLUM
IT
IS
NOT
HOWEVER
VISIBLE
FROM
THE
GROUNDS
WHEN
I
HAD
FINISHED
HE
SAID
I
AM
GLAD
THAT
IT
IS
OLD
AND
BIG
I
MYSELF
AM
OF
AN
OLD
FAMILY
AND
TOLIVE
IN
A
NEW
HOUSE
WOULD
KILL
ME
A
HOUSE
CANNOT
BE
MADE
HABITABLE
IN
ADAY
AND
AFTER
ALL
HOW
FEW
DAYS
GO
TO
MAKE
UP
A
CENTURY
I
REJOICEALSO
THAT
THERE
IS
A
CHAPEL
OF
OLD
TIMES
WE
TRANSYLVANIAN
NOBLES
LOVENOT
TO
THINK
THAT
OUR
BONES
MAY
LIE
AMONGST
THE
COMMON
DEAD
I
SEEK
NOTGAIETY
NOR
MIRTH
NOT
THE
BRIGHT
VOLUPTUOUSNESS
OF
MUCH
SUNSHINE
ANDSPARKLING
WATERS
WHICH
PLEASE
THE
YOUNG
AND
GAY
I
AM
NO
LONGER
YOUNG
AND
MY
HEART
THROUGH
WEARY
YEARS
OF
MOURNING
OVER
THE
DEAD
IS
NOTATTUNED
TO
MIRTH
MOREOVER
THE
WALLS
OF
MY

MANY
AND

COLD
THROUGH

BROKENBATTLEMENTS
AND
CASEMENTS
I
LOVE
THE
SHADE
AND
THE
SHADOW
AND
WOULDBE
ALONE
WITH
MY
THOUGHTS
WHEN
I
MAY
SOMEHOW
HIS
WORDS
AND
HIS
LOOKDID
NOT
SEEM
TO
ACCORD
OR

IT
WAS
THAT
HIS
CAST
OF
FACE
MADE
HISSMILE
LOOK
MALIGNANT
AND
SATURNINE
PRESENTLY
WITH
AN
EXCUSE
HE
LEFT
ME
ASKING
ME
TO
PUT
ALL
MY
PAPERSTOGETHER
HE
WAS
SOME
LITTLE
TIME
AWAY
AND
I
BEGAN
TO
LOOK
AT
SOME
OFTHE
BOOKS
AROUND
ME
ONE
WAS
AN
ATLAS
WHICH
I
FOUND
OPENED
NATURALLY
ATENGLAND
AS
IF
THAT
MAP
HAD
BEEN
MUCH
USED
ON
LOOKING
AT
IT
I
FOUND
INCERTAIN
PLACES
LITTLE
RINGS
MARKED
AND
ON
EXAMINING
THESE
I
NOTICEDTHAT
ONE
WAS
NEAR
LONDON
ON
THE
EAST
SIDE
MANIFESTLY
WHERE
HIS
NEWESTATE
WAS
SITUATED
THE
OTHER
TWO
WERE
EXETER
AND
WHITBY
ON
THEYORKSHIRE
COAST
IT
WAS
THE
BETTER
PART
OF
AN
HOUR
WHEN
THE
COUNT
RETURNED
AHA
HESAID
STILL
AT
YOUR
BOOKS
GOOD
BUT
YOU
MUST
NOT
WORK
ALWAYS
COME
IAM
INFORMED
THAT
YOUR
SUPPER
IS
READY
HE
TOOK
MY
ARM
AND
WE
WENT
INTOTHE
NEXT
ROOM
WHERE
I
FOUND
AN
EXCELLENT
SUPPER
READY
ON
THE
TABLE
THECOUNT
AGAIN
EXCUSED
HIMSELF
AS
HE
HAD
DINED
OUT
ON
HIS
BEING
AWAY
FROMHOME
BUT
HE
SAT
AS
ON
THE
PREVIOUS
NIGHT
AND
CHATTED
WHILST
I
ATE
AFTER
SUPPER
I
SMOKED
AS
ON
THE
LAST
EVENING
AND
THE
COUNT
STAYED
WITHME
CHATTING
AND
ASKING
QUESTIONS
ON
EVERY
CONCEIVABLE
SUBJECT
HOURAFTER
HOUR
I
FELT
THAT
IT
WAS
GETTING
VERY
LATE
INDEED
BUT
I
DID
NOTSAY
ANYTHING
FOR
I
FELT
UNDER
OBLIGATION
TO
MEET
MY
HOST
S
WISHES
INEVERY
WAY
I
WAS
NOT
SLEEPY
AS
THE
LONG
SLEEP
YESTERDAY
HAD
FORTIFIEDME
BUT
I
COULD
NOT
HELP
EXPERIENCING
THAT
CHILL
WHICH
COMES
OVER
ONE
ATTHE
COMING
OF
THE
DAWN
WHICH
IS
LIKE
IN
ITS
WAY
THE
TURN
OF
THE
TIDE
THEY
SAY
THAT
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
NEAR
DEATH
DIE
GENERALLY
AT
THE
CHANGE
TOTHE
DAWN
OR
AT
THE

OF
THE
TIDE
ANY
ONE
WHO
HAS
WHEN
TIRED
ANDTIED
AS
IT
WERE
TO
HIS
POST
EXPERIENCED
THIS
CHANGE
IN
THE
ATMOSPHERECAN
WELL
BELIEVE
IT
ALL
AT
ONCE
WE
HEARD
THE
CROW
OF
A
COCK
COMING
UPWITH
PRETERNATURAL
SHRILLNESS
THROUGH
THE
CLEAR
MORNING
AIR
COUNTDRACULA
JUMPING
TO
HIS
FEET
SAID
WHY
THERE
IS
THE
MORNING
AGAIN
HOW
REMISS
I
AM
TO
LET
YOU
STAY
UP
SOLONG
YOU
MUST
MAKE
YOUR
CONVERSATION
REGARDING
MY
DEAR
NEW
COUNTRY
OFENGLAND
LESS
INTERESTING
SO
THAT
I
MAY
NOT
FORGET
HOW
TIME
FLIES
BYUS
AND
WITH
A
COURTLY
BOW
HE
QUICKLY
LEFT
ME
I
WENT
INTO
MY
OWN
ROOM
AND
DREW
THE
CURTAINS
BUT
THERE
WAS
LITTLE
TONOTICE
MY
WINDOW
OPENED
INTO
THE
COURTYARD
ALL
I
COULD
SEE
WAS
THEWARM
GREY
OF
QUICKENING
SKY
SO
I
PULLED
THE
CURTAINS
AGAIN
AND
HAVEWRITTEN
OF
THIS
DAY
MAY
I
BEGAN
TO
FEAR
AS
I
WROTE
IN
THIS
BOOK
THAT
I
WAS
GETTING
TOODIFFUSE
BUT
NOW
I
AM
GLAD
THAT
I
WENT
INTO
DETAIL
FROM
THE
FIRST
FORTHERE
IS
SOMETHING
SO
STRANGE
ABOUT
THIS
PLACE
AND
ALL
IN
IT
THAT
ICANNOT
BUT
FEEL
UNEASY
I
WISH
I
WERE
SAFE
OUT
OF
IT
OR
THAT
I
HADNEVER
COME
IT
MAY
BE
THAT
THIS
STRANGE
NIGHT
EXISTENCE
IS
TELLING
ONME
BUT
WOULD
THAT
THAT
WERE
ALL
IF
THERE
WERE
ANY
ONE
TO
TALK
TO
ICOULD
BEAR
IT
BUT
THERE
IS
NO
ONE
I
HAVE
ONLY
THE
COUNT
TO
SPEAK
WITH
AND
HE
I
FEAR
I
AM
MYSELF
THE
ONLY
LIVING
SOUL
WITHIN
THE
PLACE
LETME
BE
PROSAIC
SO
FAR
AS
FACTS
CAN
BE
IT
WILL
HELP
ME
TO
BEAR
UP
ANDIMAGINATION
MUST
NOT
RUN
RIOT
WITH
ME
IF
IT
DOES
I
AM
LOST
LET
ME
SAYAT
ONCE
HOW
I
STAND
OR
SEEM
TO
I
ONLY
SLEPT
A
FEW
HOURS
WHEN
I
WENT
TO
BED
AND
FEELING
THAT
I
COULDNOT
SLEEP
ANY
MORE
GOT
UP
I
HAD
HUNG
MY
SHAVING
GLASS
BY
THE
WINDOW
AND
WAS
JUST
BEGINNING
TO
SHAVE
SUDDENLY
I
FELT
A
HAND
ON
MY
SHOULDER
AND
HEARD
THE
COUNT
S
VOICE
SAYING
TO
ME
GOOD
MORNING
I
STARTED
FORIT
AMAZED
ME
THAT
I
HAD
NOT
SEEN
HIM
SINCE
THE
REFLECTION
OF
THE
GLASSCOVERED
THE
WHOLE
ROOM
BEHIND
ME
IN
STARTING
I
HAD
CUT
MYSELF
SLIGHTLY
BUT
DID
NOT
NOTICE
IT
AT
THE
MOMENT
HAVING
ANSWERED
THE
COUNT
SSALUTATION
I
TURNED
TO
THE
GLASS
AGAIN
TO
SEE
HOW
I
HAD
BEEN
MISTAKEN
THIS
TIME
THERE
COULD
BE
NO
ERROR
FOR
THE
MAN
WAS
CLOSE
TO
ME
AND
ICOULD
SEE
HIM
OVER
MY
SHOULDER
BUT
THERE
WAS
NO
REFLECTION
OF
HIM
INTHE
MIRROR
THE
WHOLE
ROOM
BEHIND
ME
WAS
DISPLAYED
BUT
THERE
WAS
NOSIGN
OF
A
MAN
IN
IT
EXCEPT
MYSELF
THIS
WAS
STARTLING
AND
COMING
ONTHE
TOP
OF
SO
MANY
STRANGE
THINGS
WAS
BEGINNING
TO
INCREASE
THAT
VAGUEFEELING
OF
UNEASINESS
WHICH
I
ALWAYS
HAVE
WHEN
THE
COUNT
IS
NEAR
BUT
ATTHE
INSTANT
I
SAW
THAT
THE
CUT
HAD
BLED
A
LITTLE
AND
THE
BLOOD
WASTRICKLING
OVER
MY
CHIN
I
LAID
DOWN
THE
RAZOR
TURNING
AS
I
DID
SO
HALFROUND
TO
LOOK
FOR
SOME
STICKING
PLASTER
WHEN
THE
COUNT
SAW
MY
FACE
HISEYES
BLAZED
WITH
A
SORT
OF
DEMONIAC
FURY
AND
HE
SUDDENLY
MADE
A
GRAB
ATMY
THROAT
I
DREW
AWAY
AND
HIS
HAND
TOUCHED
THE
STRING
OF
BEADS
WHICHHELD
THE
CRUCIFIX
IT
MADE
AN
INSTANT
CHANGE
IN
HIM
FOR
THE
FURY
PASSEDSO
QUICKLY
THAT
I
COULD
HARDLY
BELIEVE
THAT
IT
WAS
EVER
THERE
TAKE
CARE
HE
SAID
TAKE
CARE
HOW
YOU
CUT
YOURSELF
IT
IS
MOREDANGEROUS
THAN
YOU
THINK
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
THEN
SEIZING
THE
SHAVINGGLASS
HE
WENT
ON
AND
THIS
IS
THE
WRETCHED
THING
THAT
HAS
DONE
THEMISCHIEF
IT
IS
A
FOUL
BAUBLE
OF
MAN
S
VANITY
AWAY
WITH
IT
ANDOPENING
THE
HEAVY
WINDOW
WITH
ONE
WRENCH
OF
HIS
TERRIBLE
HAND
HE
FLUNGOUT
THE
GLASS
WHICH
WAS
SHATTERED
INTO
A
THOUSAND
PIECES
ON
THE
STONESOF
THE
COURTYARD
FAR
BELOW
THEN
HE
WITHDREW
WITHOUT
A
WORD
IT
IS
VERYANNOYING
FOR
I
DO
NOT
SEE
HOW
I
AM
TO
SHAVE
UNLESS
IN
MY
WATCH

ORTHE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
SHAVING
POT
WHICH
IS
FORTUNATELY
OF
METAL
WHEN
I
WENT
INTO
THE
DINING
ROOM
BREAKFAST
WAS
PREPARED
BUT
I
COULDNOT

SO
I
BREAKFASTED

IS
STRANGE
THATAS

I
HAVE
NOT
SEEN
THE

EAT
OR

HE
MUST
BE
A
VERYPECULIAR
MAN
AFTER
BREAKFAST
I
DID
A
LITTLE
EXPLORING
IN
THE
CASTLE
IWENT
OUT
ON
THE
STAIRS
AND
FOUND
A
ROOM
LOOKING
TOWARDS
THE
SOUTH
THEVIEW
WAS
MAGNIFICENT
AND
FROM
WHERE
I
STOOD
THERE
WAS
EVERY
OPPORTUNITYOF
SEEING
IT
THE

IS
ON
THE
VERY
EDGE
OF
A
TERRIBLE

ASTONE
FALLING
FROM

WITHOUTTOUCHING
ANYTHING
AS
FAR
AS

WHEN
I
FOUND
THAT
I
WAS
A
PRISONER
A
SORT
OF
WILD
FEELING
CAME
OVER
ME
I
RUSHED
UP
AND
DOWN
THE
STAIRS
TRYING
EVERY
DOOR
AND
PEERING
OUT
OFEVERY
WINDOW
I
COULD
FIND
BUT
AFTER
A
LITTLE
THE
CONVICTION
OF
MYHELPLESSNESS
OVERPOWERED
ALL
OTHER
FEELINGS
WHEN
I
LOOK
BACK
AFTER
AFEW
HOURS
I
THINK
I
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
MAD
FOR
THE
TIME
FOR
I
BEHAVED
MUCHAS
A
RAT
DOES
IN
A
TRAP
WHEN
HOWEVER
THE
CONVICTION
HAD
COME
TO
METHAT
I
WAS
HELPLESS
I
SAT
DOWN
QUIETLY
AS
QUIETLY
AS
I
HAVE
EVER
DONEANYTHING
IN
MY
LIFE
AND
BEGAN
TO
THINK
OVER
WHAT
WAS
BEST
TO
BE
DONE
IAM
THINKING
STILL
AND
AS
YET
HAVE
COME
TO
NO
DEFINITE
CONCLUSION
OFONE
THING
ONLY
AM
I
CERTAIN
THAT
IT
IS
NO
USE
MAKING
MY
IDEAS
KNOWN
TOTHE
COUNT
HE
KNOWS
WELL
THAT
I
AM
IMPRISONED
AND
AS
HE
HAS
DONE
ITHIMSELF
AND
HAS
DOUBTLESS
HIS
OWN
MOTIVES
FOR
IT
HE
WOULD
ONLY
DECEIVEME
IF
I
TRUSTED
HIM
FULLY
WITH
THE
FACTS
SO
FAR
AS
I
CAN
SEE
MY
ONLYPLAN
WILL
BE
TO
KEEP
MY
KNOWLEDGE
AND
MY
FEARS
TO
MYSELF
AND
MY
EYESOPEN
I
AM
I
KNOW
EITHER
BEING
DECEIVED
LIKE
A
BABY
BY
MY
OWN
FEARS
OR
ELSE
I
AM
IN
DESPERATE
STRAITS
AND
IF
THE
LATTER
BE
SO
I
NEED
ANDSHALL
NEED
ALL
MY
BRAINS
TO
GET
THROUGH
I
HAD
HARDLY
COME
TO
THIS
CONCLUSION
WHEN
I
HEARD
THE
GREAT
DOOR
BELOWSHUT
AND
KNEW
THAT
THE
COUNT
HAD
RETURNED
HE
DID
NOT
COME
AT
ONCE
INTOTHE
LIBRARY
SO
I
WENT
CAUTIOUSLY
TO
MY
OWN
ROOM
AND
FOUND
HIM
MAKINGTHE
BED
THIS
WAS
ODD
BUT
ONLY
CONFIRMED
WHAT
I
HAD
ALL
ALONGTHOUGHT
THAT
THERE
WERE
NO
SERVANTS
IN
THE
HOUSE
WHEN
LATER
I
SAW
HIMTHROUGH
THE
CHINK
OF
THE
HINGES
OF
THE
DOOR
LAYING
THE
TABLE
IN
THEDINING
ROOM
I
WAS
ASSURED
OF
IT
FOR
IF
HE
DOES
HIMSELF
ALL
THESEMENIAL
OFFICES
SURELY
IT
IS
PROOF
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
ONE
ELSE
TO
DO
THEM
THIS
GAVE
ME
A
FRIGHT
FOR
IF
THERE
IS
NO
ONE
ELSE
IN
THE
CASTLE
ITMUST
HAVE
BEEN
THE
COUNT
HIMSELF
WHO
WAS
THE
DRIVER
OF
THE

THATBROUGHT
ME
HERE
THIS
IS
A
TERRIBLE
THOUGHT
FOR
IF
SO
WHAT
DOES
ITMEAN
THAT
HE
COULD
CONTROL
THE
WOLVES
AS
HE
DID
BY
ONLY
HOLDING
UP
HISHAND
IN
SILENCE
HOW
WAS
IT
THAT
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
AT
BISTRITZ
AND
ON

HAD
SOME
TERRIBLE
FEAR
FOR

WHENEVER

IT
IS
ODD
THAT
A

I
HAVE
BEEN

TO
REGARD
WITH
DISFAVOUR
AND
AS
IDOLATROUSSHOULD
IN

OF

AND

IS
IT
THAT
THEREIS
SOMETHING
IN
THE
ESSENCE
OF

THAT
IT
IS
A
MEDIUM
A
TANGIBLE
HELP
IN
CONVEYING
MEMORIES
OF
SYMPATHY
AND

SOMETIME
IF
IT
MAY
BE
I
MUST
EXAMINE
THIS

OUT
ALL

WAY
I
MUST
BE
VERY
CAREFUL
HOWEVER
NOT

MIDNIGHT
I
HAVE
HAD
A
LONG
TALK
WITH
THE

ASKED
HIM
A
FEWQUESTIONS
ON

HISTORY
AND
HE
WARMED
UP
TO
THE
SUBJECTWONDERFULLY
IN
HIS
SPEAKING
OF

AND

AND
ESPECIALLY
OFBATTLES
HE
SPOKE
AS
IF
HE
HAD
BEEN
PRESENT
AT

EXPLAINED
BY
SAYING
THAT
TO
A
BOYAR
THE

HIS

PRIDE
THAT
THEIR
GLORY
IS

ALMOST
IN

LIKE
A
KING
SPEAKING
I
WISH
I
COULD
PUTDOWN
ALL
HE
SAID
EXACTLY
AS
HE
SAID
IT

THAT
MUSHROOM
GROWTHS
LIKE
THEHAPSBURGS
AND
THE

CAN
NEVER
REACH
THE
WARLIKE
DAYS
ARE
OVER
BLOOD
IS
TOO
PRECIOUS
A
THING
IN
THESE
DAYS
OF
DISHONOURABLE
PEACE
ANDTHE
GLORIES
OF
THE
GREAT
RACES
ARE
AS
A
TALE
THAT
IS
TOLD
IT
WAS
BY
THIS
TIME
CLOSE
ON
MORNING
AND
WE
WENT
TO
BED
MEM
THISDIARY
SEEMS
HORRIBLY
LIKE
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
ARABIAN
NIGHTS
FOREVERYTHING
HAS
TO
BREAK
OFF
AT
COCKCROW
OR
LIKE
THE
GHOST
OF
HAMLET
SFATHER
MAY
LET
ME
BEGIN
WITH
FACTS
BARE
MEAGRE
FACTS
VERIFIED
BYBOOKS
AND
FIGURES
AND
OF
WHICH
THERE
CAN
BE
NO
DOUBT
I
MUST
NOTCONFUSE
THEM
WITH
EXPERIENCES
WHICH
WILL
HAVE
TO
REST
ON
MY
OWNOBSERVATION
OR
MY
MEMORY
OF
THEM
LAST
EVENING
WHEN
THE
COUNT
CAME
FROMHIS
ROOM
HE
BEGAN
BY
ASKING
ME
QUESTIONS
ON
LEGAL
MATTERS
AND
ON
THEDOING
OF
CERTAIN
KINDS
OF
BUSINESS
I
HAD
SPENT
THE
DAY
WEARILY
OVERBOOKS
AND
SIMPLY
TO
KEEP
MY
MIND
OCCUPIED
WENT
OVER
SOME
OF
THEMATTERS
I
HAD
BEEN
EXAMINED
IN
AT
LINCOLN
S
INN
THERE
WAS
A
CERTAINMETHOD
IN
THE
COUNT
S
INQUIRIES
SO
I
SHALL
TRY
TO
PUT
THEM
DOWN
INSEQUENCE
THE
KNOWLEDGE
MAY
SOMEHOW
OR
SOME
TIME
BE
USEFUL
TO
ME
FIRST
HE
ASKED
IF
A
MAN
IN
ENGLAND
MIGHT
HAVE
TWO
SOLICITORS
OR
MORE
ITOLD
HIM
HE
MIGHT
HAVE
A
DOZEN
IF
HE
WISHED
BUT
THAT
IT
WOULD
NOT
BEWISE
TO
HAVE
MORE
THAN
ONE
SOLICITOR
ENGAGED
IN
ONE
TRANSACTION
AS
ONLYONE
COULD
ACT
AT
A
TIME
AND
THAT
TO
CHANGE
WOULD
BE
CERTAIN
TO
MILITATEAGAINST
HIS
INTEREST
HE
SEEMED
THOROUGHLY
TO
UNDERSTAND
AND
WENT
ON
TOASK
IF
THERE
WOULD
BE
ANY
PRACTICAL
DIFFICULTY
IN
HAVING
ONE
MAN
TOATTEND
SAY
TO
BANKING
AND
ANOTHER
TO
LOOK
AFTER
SHIPPING
IN
CASELOCAL
HELP
WERE
NEEDED
IN
A
PLACE
FAR
FROM
THE
HOME
OF
THE
BANKINGSOLICITOR
I
ASKED
HIM
TO
EXPLAIN
MORE
FULLY
SO
THAT
I
MIGHT
NOT
BY
ANYCHANCE
MISLEAD
HIM
SO
HE
SAID
I
SHALL
ILLUSTRATE
YOUR
FRIEND
AND
MINE
MR
PETER
HAWKINS
FROM
UNDERTHE
SHADOW
OF
YOUR
BEAUTIFUL
CATHEDRAL
AT
EXETER
WHICH
IS
FAR
FROMLONDON
BUYS
FOR
ME
THROUGH
YOUR
GOOD
SELF
MY
PLACE
AT
LONDON
GOOD
NOWHERE
LET
ME
SAY
FRANKLY
LEST
YOU
SHOULD
THINK
IT
STRANGE
THAT
I
HAVESOUGHT
THE
SERVICES
OF
ONE
SO
FAR
OFF
FROM
LONDON
INSTEAD
OF
SOME
ONERESIDENT
THERE
THAT
MY
MOTIVE
WAS
THAT
NO
LOCAL
INTEREST
MIGHT
BESERVED
SAVE
MY
WISH
ONLY
AND
AS
ONE
OF
LONDON
RESIDENCE
MIGHT
PERHAPS
HAVE
SOME
PURPOSE
OF
HIMSELF
OR
FRIEND
TO
SERVE
I
WENT
THUS
AFIELD
TOSEEK
MY
AGENT
WHOSE
LABOURS
SHOULD
BE
ONLY
TO
MY
INTEREST
NOW
SUPPOSEI
WHO
HAVE
MUCH
OF
AFFAIRS
WISH
TO
SHIP
GOODS
SAY
TO
NEWCASTLE
ORDURHAM
OR
HARWICH
OR
DOVER
MIGHT
IT
NOT
BE
THAT
IT
COULD
WITH
MOREEASE
BE
DONE
BY
CONSIGNING
TO
ONE
IN
THESE
PORTS
I
ANSWERED
THATCERTAINLY
IT
WOULD
BE
MOST
EASY
BUT
THAT
WE
SOLICITORS
HAD
A
SYSTEM
OFAGENCY
ONE
FOR
THE
OTHER
SO
THAT
LOCAL
WORK
COULD
BE
DONE
LOCALLY
ONINSTRUCTION
FROM
ANY
SOLICITOR
SO
THAT
THE
CLIENT
SIMPLY
PLACINGHIMSELF
IN
THE
HANDS
OF
ONE
MAN
COULD
HAVE
HIS
WISHES
CARRIED
OUT
BYHIM
WITHOUT
FURTHER
TROUBLE
BUT
SAID
HE
I
COULD
BE
AT
LIBERTY
TO
DIRECT
MYSELF
IS
IT
NOT
SO
OF
COURSE
I
REPLIED
AND
SUCH
IS
OFTEN
DONE
BY
MEN
OF
BUSINESS
WHODO
NOT
LIKE
THE
WHOLE
OF
THEIR
AFFAIRS
TO
BE
KNOWN
BY
ANY
ONE
PERSON
GOOD
HE
SAID
AND
THEN
WENT
ON
TO
ASK
ABOUT
THE
MEANS
OF
MAKINGCONSIGNMENTS
AND
THE
FORMS
TO
BE
GONE
THROUGH
AND
OF
ALL
SORTS
OFDIFFICULTIES
WHICH
MIGHT
ARISE
BUT
BY
FORETHOUGHT
COULD
BE
GUARDEDAGAINST
I
EXPLAINED
ALL
THESE
THINGS
TO
HIM
TO
THE
BEST
OF
MY
ABILITY
AND
HE
CERTAINLY
LEFT
ME
UNDER
THE
IMPRESSION
THAT
HE
WOULD
HAVE
MADE
AWONDERFUL
SOLICITOR
FOR
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
THAT
HE
DID
NOT
THINK
OF
ORFORESEE
FOR
A
MAN
WHO
WAS
NEVER
IN
THE
COUNTRY
AND
WHO
DID
NOTEVIDENTLY
DO
MUCH
IN
THE
WAY
OF
BUSINESS
HIS
KNOWLEDGE
AND
ACUMEN
WEREWONDERFUL
WHEN
HE
HAD
SATISFIED
HIMSELF
ON
THESE
POINTS
OF
WHICH
HE
HADSPOKEN
AND
I
HAD
VERIFIED
ALL
AS
WELL
AS
I
COULD
BY
THE
BOOKSAVAILABLE
HE
SUDDENLY
STOOD
UP
AND
SAID
HAVE
YOU
WRITTEN
SINCE
YOUR
FIRST
LETTER
TO
OUR
FRIEND
MR
PETERHAWKINS
OR
TO
ANY
OTHER
IT
WAS
WITH
SOME
BITTERNESS
IN
MY
HEART
THATI
ANSWERED
THAT
I
HAD
NOT
THAT
AS
YET
I
HAD
NOT
SEEN
ANY
OPPORTUNITY
OFSENDING
LETTERS
TO
ANYBODY
THEN
WRITE
NOW
MY
YOUNG
FRIEND
HE
SAID
LAYING
A
HEAVY
HAND
ON
MYSHOULDER
WRITE
TO
OUR
FRIEND
AND
TO
ANY
OTHER
AND
SAY
IF
IT
WILLPLEASE
YOU
THAT
YOU
SHALL
STAY
WITH
ME
UNTIL
A
MONTH
FROM
NOW
DO
YOU
WISH
ME
TO
STAY
SO
LONG
I
ASKED
FOR
MY
HEART
GREW
COLD
AT
THETHOUGHT
I
DESIRE
IT
MUCH
NAY
I
WILL
TAKE
NO
REFUSAL
WHEN
YOUR
MASTER
EMPLOYER
WHAT
YOU
WILL
ENGAGED
THAT
SOMEONE
SHOULD
COME
ON
HIS
BEHALF
IT
WAS
UNDERSTOOD
THAT
MY
NEEDS
ONLY
WERE
TO
BE
CONSULTED
I
HAVE
NOTSTINTED
IS
IT
NOT
SO
WHAT
COULD
I
DO
BUT
BOW
ACCEPTANCE
IT
WAS
MR
HAWKINS
S
INTEREST
NOTMINE
AND
I
HAD
TO
THINK
OF
HIM
NOT
MYSELF
AND
BESIDES
WHILE
COUNTDRACULA
WAS
SPEAKING
THERE
WAS
THAT
IN
HIS
EYES
AND
IN
HIS
BEARINGWHICH
MADE
ME
REMEMBER
THAT
I
WAS
A
PRISONER
AND
THAT
IF
I
WISHED
IT
ICOULD
HAVE
NO
CHOICE
THE
COUNT
SAW
HIS
VICTORY
IN
MY
BOW
AND
HISMASTERY
IN
THE
TROUBLE
OF
MY
FACE
FOR
HE
BEGAN
AT
ONCE
TO
USE
THEM
BUTIN
HIS
OWN
SMOOTH
RESISTLESS
WAY
I
PRAY
YOU
MY
GOOD
YOUNG
FRIEND
THAT
YOU
WILL
NOT
DISCOURSE
OF
THINGSOTHER
THAN
BUSINESS
IN
YOUR
LETTERS
IT
WILL
DOUBTLESS
PLEASE
YOURFRIENDS
TO
KNOW
THAT
YOU
ARE
WELL
AND
THAT
YOU
LOOK
FORWARD
TO
GETTINGHOME
TO
THEM
IS
IT
NOT
SO
AS
HE
SPOKE
HE
HANDED
ME
THREE
SHEETS
OFNOTE
PAPER
AND
THREE
ENVELOPES
THEY
WERE
ALL
OF
THE
THINNEST
FOREIGNPOST
AND
LOOKING
AT
THEM
THEN
AT
HIM
AND
NOTICING
HIS
QUIET
SMILE
WITH
THE
SHARP
CANINE
TEETH
LYING
OVER
THE
RED
UNDERLIP
I
UNDERSTOODAS
WELL
AS
IF
HE
HAD
SPOKEN
THAT
I
SHOULD
BE
CAREFUL
WHAT
I
WROTE
FORHE
WOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
READ
IT
SO
I
DETERMINED
TO
WRITE
ONLY
FORMAL
NOTESNOW
BUT
TO
WRITE
FULLY
TO
MR
HAWKINS
IN
SECRET
AND
ALSO
TO
MINA
FORTO
HER
I
COULD
WRITE
IN
SHORTHAND
WHICH
WOULD
PUZZLE
THE
COUNT
IF
HEDID
SEE
IT
WHEN
I
HAD
WRITTEN
MY
TWO
LETTERS
I
SAT
QUIET
READING
ABOOK
WHILST
THE
COUNT
WROTE
SEVERAL
NOTES
REFERRING
AS
HE
WROTE
THEM
TOSOME
BOOKS
ON
HIS

THEN
HE
TOOK
UP
MY
TWO
AND
PLACED
THEM
WITH
HISOWN
AND
PUT
BY
HIS
WRITING
MATERIALS
AFTER
WHICH
THE
INSTANT
THE
DOORHAD
CLOSED
BEHIND
HIM
I
LEANED
OVER
AND
LOOKED
AT
THE
LETTERS
WHICHWERE
FACE
DOWN
ON
THE
TABLE
I
FELT
NO
COMPUNCTION
IN
DOING
SO
FORUNDER
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
I
FELT
THAT
I
SHOULD
PROTECT
MYSELF
IN
EVERY
WAYI
COULD
ONE
OF
THE

TO

I
SANK
BACK
IN
MYSEAT
HAVING
JUST
HAD
TIME
TO
REPLACE
THE
LETTERS
AS
THEY
HAD
BEEN
ANDTO
RESUME
MY
BOOK
BEFORE
THE

HOLDING
STILL
ANOTHER
LETTER
IN
HISHAND
ENTERED
THE
ROOM
HE
TOOK
UP
THE
LETTERS
ON
THE
TABLE
AND
STAMPEDTHEM
CAREFULLY
AND
THEN
TURNING
TO
ME
SAID
I
TRUST
YOU
WILL
FORGIVE
ME
BUT
I
HAVE
MUCH
WORK
TO
DO
IN
PRIVATE
THISEVENING
YOU
WILL
I
HOPE
FIND
ALL
THINGS
AS
YOU
WISH
AT
THE
DOOR
HETURNED
AND
AFTER
A
MOMENT
S
PAUSE
SAID
LET
ME
ADVISE
YOU
MY
DEAR
YOUNG
FRIEND
NAY
LET
ME
WARN
YOU
WITH
ALLSERIOUSNESS
THAT
SHOULD
YOU
LEAVE
THESE
ROOMS
YOU
WILL
NOT
BY
ANYCHANCE
GO
TO
SLEEP
IN
ANY
OTHER
PART
OF
THE
CASTLE
IT
IS
OLD
AND
HASMANY
MEMORIES
AND
THERE
ARE
BAD
DREAMS
FOR
THOSE
WHO
SLEEP
UNWISELY
BEWARNED
SHOULD
SLEEP
NOW
OR
EVER
OVERCOME
YOU
OR
BE
LIKE
TO
DO
THENHASTE
TO
YOUR
OWN
CHAMBER
OR
TO
THESE
ROOMS
FOR
YOUR
REST
WILL
THEN
BESAFE
BUT
IF
YOU
BE
NOT
CAREFUL
IN
THIS
RESPECT
THEN
HE
FINISHED
HISSPEECH
IN
A
GRUESOME
WAY
FOR
HE
MOTIONED
WITH
HIS
HANDS
AS
IF
HE
WEREWASHING
THEM
I
QUITE
UNDERSTOOD
MY
ONLY
DOUBT
WAS
AS
TO
WHETHER
ANYDREAM
COULD
BE
MORE
TERRIBLE
THAN
THE
UNNATURAL
HORRIBLE
NET
OF
GLOOMAND
MYSTERY
WHICH
SEEMED
CLOSING
AROUND
ME
LATER
I
ENDORSE
THE
LAST
WORDS
WRITTEN
BUT
THIS
TIME
THERE
IS
NODOUBT
IN
QUESTION
I
SHALL
NOT
FEAR
TO
SLEEP
IN
ANY
PLACE
WHERE
HE
ISNOT
I
HAVE
PLACED
THE
CRUCIFIX
OVER
THE
HEAD
OF
MY
BED
I
IMAGINE
THATMY
REST
IS
THUS
FREER
FROM
DREAMS
AND
THERE
IT
SHALL
REMAIN
WHEN
HE
LEFT
ME
I
WENT
TO
MY
ROOM
AFTER
A
LITTLE
WHILE
NOT
HEARING
ANYSOUND
I
CAME
OUT
AND
WENT
UP
THE
STONE
STAIR
TO
WHERE
I
COULD
LOOK
OUTTOWARDS
THE
SOUTH
THERE
WAS
SOME
SENSE
OF
FREEDOM
IN
THE
VAST
EXPANSE
INACCESSIBLE
THOUGH
IT
WAS
TO
ME
AS
COMPARED
WITH
THE
NARROW
DARKNESSOF
THE
COURTYARD
LOOKING
OUT
ON
THIS
I
FELT
THAT
I
WAS
INDEED
INPRISON
AND
I
SEEMED
TO
WANT
A
BREATH
OF
FRESH
AIR
THOUGH
IT
WERE
OFTHE
NIGHT
I
AM
BEGINNING
TO
FEEL
THIS
NOCTURNAL
EXISTENCE
TELL
ON
ME
IT
IS
DESTROYING
MY
NERVE
I
START
AT
MY
OWN
SHADOW
AND
AM
FULL
OF
ALLSORTS
OF
HORRIBLE
IMAGININGS
GOD
KNOWS
THAT
THERE
IS
GROUND
FOR
MYTERRIBLE
FEAR
IN
THIS
ACCURSED
PLACE
I
LOOKED
OUT
OVER
THE
BEAUTIFULEXPANSE
BATHED
IN
SOFT
YELLOW
MOONLIGHT
TILL
IT
WAS
ALMOST
AS
LIGHT
ASDAY
IN
THE
SOFT
LIGHT
THE
DISTANT
HILLS
BECAME
MELTED
AND
THE
SHADOWSIN
THE
VALLEYS
AND
GORGES
OF
VELVETY
BLACKNESS
THE
MERE
BEAUTY
SEEMEDTO
CHEER
ME
THERE
WAS
PEACE
AND
COMFORT
IN
EVERY
BREATH
I
DREW
AS
ILEANED
FROM
THE
WINDOW
MY
EYE
WAS
CAUGHT
BY
SOMETHING
MOVING
A
STOREYBELOW
ME
AND
SOMEWHAT
TO
MY
LEFT
WHERE
I
IMAGINED
FROM
THE
ORDER
OFTHE
ROOMS
THAT
THE
WINDOWS
OF
THE
COUNT
S
OWN
ROOM
WOULD
LOOK
OUT
THEWINDOW
AT
WHICH
I
STOOD
WAS
TALL
AND
DEEP
STONE
MULLIONED
AND
THOUGHWEATHERWORN
WAS
STILL
COMPLETE
BUT
IT
WAS
EVIDENTLY
MANY
A
DAY
SINCETHE
CASE
HAD
BEEN
THERE
I
DREW
BACK
BEHIND
THE
STONEWORK
AND
LOOKEDCAREFULLY
OUT
WHAT
I
SAW
WAS
THE
COUNT
S
HEAD
COMING
OUT
FROM
THE
WINDOW
I
DID
NOTSEE
THE
FACE
BUT
I
KNEW
THE
MAN
BY
THE
NECK
AND
THE
MOVEMENT
OF
HISBACK
AND
ARMS
IN
ANY
CASE
I
COULD
NOT
MISTAKE
THE
HANDS
WHICH
I
HAD
HADSO
MANY
OPPORTUNITIES
OF
STUDYING
I
WAS
AT
FIRST
INTERESTED
ANDSOMEWHAT
AMUSED
FOR
IT
IS
WONDERFUL
HOW
SMALL
A
MATTER
WILL
INTERESTAND
AMUSE
A
MAN
WHEN
HE
IS
A
PRISONER
BUT
MY
VERY
FEELINGS
CHANGED
TOREPULSION
AND
TERROR
WHEN
I
SAW
THE
WHOLE
MAN
SLOWLY
EMERGE
FROM
THEWINDOW
AND
BEGIN
TO
CRAWL
DOWN
THE
CASTLE
WALL
OVER
THAT
DREADFUL
ABYSS
FACE
DOWN
WITH
HIS
CLOAK
SPREADING
OUT
AROUND
HIM
LIKE
GREAT
WINGS
ATFIRST
I
COULD
NOT
BELIEVE
MY
EYES
I
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
SOME
TRICK
OF
THEMOONLIGHT
SOME
WEIRD
EFFECT
OF
SHADOW
BUT
I
KEPT
LOOKING
AND
IT
COULDBE
NO
DELUSION
I
SAW
THE
FINGERS
AND
TOES
GRASP
THE
CORNERS
OF
THESTONES
WORN
CLEAR
OF
THE
MORTAR
BY
THE
STRESS
OF
YEARS
AND
BY
THUSUSING
EVERY
PROJECTION
AND
INEQUALITY
MOVE
DOWNWARDS
WITH
CONSIDERABLESPEED
JUST
AS
A
LIZARD
MOVES
ALONG
A
WALL
WHAT
MANNER
OF
MAN
IS
THIS
OR
WHAT
MANNER
OF
CREATURE
IS
IT
IN
THESEMBLANCE
OF
MAN
I
FEEL
THE
DREAD
OF
THIS
HORRIBLE
PLACE
OVERPOWERINGME
I
AM
IN
FEAR
IN
AWFUL
FEAR
AND
THERE
IS
NO
ESCAPE
FOR
ME
I
AMENCOMPASSED
ABOUT
WITH
TERRORS
THAT
I
DARE
NOT
THINK
OF
MAY
ONCE
MORE
HAVE
I
SEEN
THE
COUNT
GO
OUT
IN
HIS
LIZARD
FASHION
HE
MOVED
DOWNWARDS
IN
A
SIDELONG
WAY
SOME
HUNDRED
FEET
DOWN
AND
A
GOODDEAL
TO
THE
LEFT
HE
VANISHED
INTO
SOME
HOLE
OR
WINDOW
WHEN
HIS
HEADHAD
DISAPPEARED
I
LEANED
OUT
TO
TRY
AND
SEE
MORE
BUT
WITHOUTAVAIL
THE
DISTANCE
WAS
TOO
GREAT
TO
ALLOW
A
PROPER
ANGLE
OF
SIGHT
IKNEW
HE
HAD
LEFT
THE
CASTLE
NOW
AND
THOUGHT
TO
USE
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TOEXPLORE
MORE
THAN
I
HAD
DARED
TO
DO
AS
YET
I
WENT
BACK
TO
THE
ROOM
ANDTAKING
A
LAMP
TRIED
ALL
THE
DOORS
THEY
WERE
ALL
LOCKED
AS
I
HADEXPECTED
AND
THE
LOCKS
WERE
COMPARATIVELY
NEW
BUT
I
WENT
DOWN
THESTONE
STAIRS
TO
THE
HALL
WHERE
I
HAD
ENTERED
ORIGINALLY
I
FOUND
I
COULDPULL
BACK
THE
BOLTS
EASILY
ENOUGH
AND
UNHOOK
THE
GREAT
CHAINS
BUT
THEDOOR
WAS
LOCKED
AND
THE
KEY
WAS
GONE
THAT
KEY
MUST
BE
IN
THE
COUNT
SROOM
I
MUST
WATCH
SHOULD
HIS
DOOR
BE
UNLOCKED
SO
THAT
I
MAY
GET
IT
ANDESCAPE
I
WENT
ON
TO
MAKE
A
THOROUGH
EXAMINATION
OF
THE
VARIOUS
STAIRSAND
PASSAGES
AND
TO
TRY
THE
DOORS
THAT
OPENED
FROM
THEM
ONE
OR
TWOSMALL
ROOMS
NEAR
THE
HALL
WERE
OPEN
BUT
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
TO
SEE
INTHEM
EXCEPT
OLD
FURNITURE
DUSTY
WITH
AGE
AND
MOTH
EATEN
AT
LAST
HOWEVER
I
FOUND
ONE
DOOR
AT
THE
TOP
OF
THE
STAIRWAY
WHICH
THOUGH
ITSEEMED
TO
BE
LOCKED
GAVE
A
LITTLE
UNDER
PRESSURE
I
TRIED
IT
HARDER
AND
FOUND
THAT
IT
WAS
NOT
REALLY
LOCKED
BUT
THAT
THE
RESISTANCE
CAMEFROM
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
HINGES
HAD
FALLEN
SOMEWHAT
AND
THE
HEAVY
DOORRESTED
ON
THE
FLOOR
HERE
WAS
AN
OPPORTUNITY
WHICH
I
MIGHT
NOT
HAVEAGAIN
SO
I
EXERTED
MYSELF
AND
WITH
MANY
EFFORTS
FORCED
IT
BACK
SO
THATI
COULD
ENTER
I
WAS
NOW
IN
A
WING
OF
THE
CASTLE
FURTHER
TO
THE
RIGHTTHAN
THE
ROOMS
I
KNEW
AND
A
STOREY
LOWER
DOWN
FROM
THE
WINDOWS
I
COULDSEE
THAT
THE
SUITE
OF
ROOMS
LAY
ALONG
TO
THE
SOUTH
OF
THE
CASTLE
THEWINDOWS
OF
THE
END
ROOM
LOOKING
OUT
BOTH
WEST
AND
SOUTH
ON
THE
LATTERSIDE
AS
WELL
AS
TO
THE
FORMER
THERE
WAS
A
GREAT
PRECIPICE
THE
CASTLEWAS
BUILT
ON
THE
CORNER
OF
A
GREAT
ROCK
SO
THAT
ON
THREE
SIDES
IT
WASQUITE
IMPREGNABLE
AND
GREAT
WINDOWS
WERE
PLACED
HERE
WHERE
SLING
ORBOW
OR
CULVERIN
COULD
NOT
REACH
AND
CONSEQUENTLY
LIGHT
AND
COMFORT
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
A
POSITION
WHICH
HAD
TO
BE
GUARDED
WERE
SECURED
TO
THEWEST
WAS
A
GREAT
VALLEY
AND
THEN
RISING
FAR
AWAY
GREAT
JAGGEDMOUNTAIN
FASTNESSES
RISING
PEAK
ON
PEAK
THE

ROCK
STUDDED
WITHMOUNTAIN
ASH
AND
THORN
WHOSE
ROOTS
CLUNG
IN
CRACKS
AND
CREVICES
ANDCRANNIES
OF
THE
STONE
THIS
WAS
EVIDENTLY
THE
PORTION
OF
THE
CASTLEOCCUPIED
BY
THE
LADIES
IN
BYGONE
DAYS
FOR
THE
FURNITURE
HAD
MORE
AIR
OFCOMFORT
THAN
ANY
I
HAD
SEEN
THE
WINDOWS
WERE

REPLACED

I
FELT
SLEEPY
THE

S
WARNING
CAME
INTO
MY

BUT
I
TOOK
A
PLEASURE
IN
DISOBEYING
IT
THE
SENSE
OF
SLEEP
WAS
UPON
ME
AND
WITH
IT
THE
OBSTINACY
WHICH
SLEEP
BRINGS
AS
OUTRIDER
THE
SOFTMOONLIGHT
SOOTHED
AND
THE
WIDE
EXPANSE
WITHOUT
GAVE
A
SENSE
OF
FREEDOMWHICH
REFRESHED
ME
I
DETERMINED
NOT
TO
RETURN
TO
NIGHT
TO
THEGLOOM
HAUNTED
ROOMS
BUT
TO
SLEEP
HERE
WHERE
OF
OLD
LADIES
HAD
SATAND
SUNG
AND
LIVED
SWEET
LIVES
WHILST
THEIR
GENTLE
BREASTS
WERE
SAD
FORTHEIR
MENFOLK
AWAY
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
REMORSELESS
WARS
I
DREW
A
GREATCOUCH
OUT
OF
ITS
PLACE
NEAR
THE
CORNER
SO
THAT
AS
I
LAY
I
COULD
LOOKAT
THE
LOVELY
VIEW
TO
EAST
AND
SOUTH
AND
UNTHINKING
OF
AND
UNCARING
FORTHE
DUST
COMPOSED
MYSELF
FOR

I
SUPPOSE
I
MUST
HAVE
FALLENASLEEP
I
HOPE
SO
BUT
I
FEAR
FOR
ALL
THAT
FOLLOWED
WAS
STARTLINGLYREAL
SO
REAL
THAT
NOW
SITTING
HERE
IN
THE
BROAD
FULL
SUNLIGHT
OF
THEMORNING
I
CANNOT
IN
THE
LEAST
BELIEVE
THAT
IT
WAS
ALL
SLEEP
I
WAS
NOT
ALONE
THE
ROOM
WAS
THE
SAME
UNCHANGED
IN
ANY
WAY
SINCE
ICAME
INTO
IT
I
COULD
SEE
ALONG
THE
FLOOR
IN
THE
BRILLIANT
MOONLIGHT
MY
OWN
FOOTSTEPS
MARKED
WHERE
I
HAD
DISTURBED
THE
LONG
ACCUMULATION
OFDUST
IN
THE
MOONLIGHT
OPPOSITE
ME
WERE
THREE
YOUNG
WOMEN
LADIES
BYTHEIR
DRESS
AND
MANNER
I
THOUGHT
AT
THE
TIME
THAT
I
MUST
BE
DREAMINGWHEN
I
SAW
THEM
FOR
THOUGH
THE
MOONLIGHT
WAS
BEHIND
THEM
THEY
THREWNO
SHADOW
ON
THE
FLOOR
THEY
CAME
CLOSE
TO
ME
AND
LOOKED
AT
ME
FOR
SOMETIME
AND
THEN
WHISPERED
TOGETHER
TWO
WERE
DARK
AND
HAD
HIGH
AQUILINENOSES
LIKE
THE
COUNT
AND
GREAT
DARK
PIERCING
EYES
THAT
SEEMED
TO
BEALMOST
RED
WHEN
CONTRASTED
WITH
THE
PALE
YELLOW
MOON
THE
OTHER
WASFAIR
AS
FAIR
AS
CAN
BE
WITH
GREAT
WAVY
MASSES
OF
GOLDEN
HAIR
AND
EYESLIKE
PALE
SAPPHIRES
I
SEEMED
SOMEHOW
TO
KNOW
HER
FACE
AND
TO
KNOW
ITIN
CONNECTION
WITH
SOME
DREAMY
FEAR
BUT
I
COULD
NOT
RECOLLECT
AT
THEMOMENT
HOW
OR
WHERE
ALL
THREE
HAD
BRILLIANT
WHITE
TEETH
THAT
SHONE
LIKEPEARLS
AGAINST
THE
RUBY
OF
THEIR
VOLUPTUOUS
LIPS
THERE
WAS
SOMETHINGABOUT
THEM
THAT
MADE
ME
UNEASY
SOME
LONGING
AND
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
SOMEDEADLY
FEAR
I
FELT
IN
MY
HEART
A
WICKED
BURNING
DESIRE
THAT
THEY
WOULDKISS
ME
WITH
THOSE
RED
LIPS
IT
IS
NOT
GOOD
TO
NOTE
THIS
DOWN
LEST
SOMEDAY
IT
SHOULD
MEET
MINA
S
EYES
AND
CAUSE
HER
PAIN
BUT
IT
IS
THE
TRUTH
THEY
WHISPERED
TOGETHER
AND
THEN
THEY
ALL
THREE
LAUGHED
SUCH
ASILVERY
MUSICAL
LAUGH
BUT
AS
HARD
AS
THOUGH
THE
SOUND
NEVER
COULD
HAVECOME
THROUGH
THE
SOFTNESS
OF
HUMAN
LIPS
IT
WAS
LIKE
THE
INTOLERABLE
TINGLING
SWEETNESS
OF
WATER
GLASSES
WHEN
PLAYED
ON
BY
A
CUNNING
HAND
THE
FAIR
GIRL
SHOOK
HER
HEAD
COQUETTISHLY
AND
THE
OTHER
TWO
URGED
HERON
ONE
SAID
GO
ON
YOU
ARE
FIRST
AND
WE
SHALL
FOLLOW
YOURS
IS
THE
RIGHT
TOBEGIN
THE
OTHER
ADDED
HE
IS
YOUNG
AND
STRONG
THERE
ARE
KISSES
FOR
US
ALL
I
LAY
QUIET
LOOKING
OUT
UNDER
MY
EYELASHES
IN
AN
AGONY
OF
DELIGHTFUL
ANTICIPATION
THE
FAIR
GIRL
ADVANCED
AND
BENT
OVER
ME
TILL
I
COULD
FEEL
THE
MOVEMENTOF
HER
BREATH
UPON
ME
SWEET
IT
WAS
IN
ONE
SENSE
HONEY
SWEET
AND
SENTTHE
SAME
TINGLING
THROUGH
THE
NERVES
AS
HER
VOICE
BUT
WITH
A
BITTERUNDERLYING
THE
SWEET
A
BITTER
OFFENSIVENESS
AS
ONE
SMELLS
IN
BLOOD
I
WAS
AFRAID
TO
RAISE
MY
EYELIDS
BUT
LOOKED
OUT
AND
SAW
PERFECTLY
UNDERTHE
LASHES
THE
GIRL
WENT
ON
HER
KNEES
AND
BENT
OVER
ME
SIMPLYGLOATING
THERE
WAS
A
DELIBERATE
VOLUPTUOUSNESS
WHICH
WAS
BOTH
THRILLINGAND
REPULSIVE
AND
AS
SHE
ARCHED
HER
NECK
SHE
ACTUALLY
LICKED
HER
LIPSLIKE
AN
ANIMAL
TILL
I
COULD
SEE
IN
THE
MOONLIGHT
THE
MOISTURE
SHININGON
THE
SCARLET
LIPS
AND
ON
THE
RED
TONGUE
AS
IT
LAPPED
THE
WHITE
SHARPTEETH
LOWER
AND
LOWER
WENT
HER
HEAD
AS
THE
LIPS
WENT
BELOW
THE
RANGE
OFMY
MOUTH
AND
CHIN
AND
SEEMED
ABOUT
TO
FASTEN
ON
MY
THROAT
THEN
SHEPAUSED
AND
I
COULD
HEAR
THE
CHURNING
SOUND
OF
HER
TONGUE
AS
IT
LICKEDHER
TEETH
AND
LIPS
AND
COULD
FEEL
THE
HOT
BREATH
ON
MY
NECK
THEN
THESKIN
OF
MY
THROAT
BEGAN
TO
TINGLE
AS
ONE
S
FLESH
DOES
WHEN
THE
HAND
THATIS
TO
TICKLE
IT
APPROACHES
NEARER
NEARER
I
COULD
FEEL
THE
SOFT
SHIVERING
TOUCH
OF
THE
LIPS
ON
THE
SUPER
SENSITIVE
SKIN
OF
MY
THROAT
AND
THE
HARD
DENTS
OF
TWO
SHARP
TEETH
JUST
TOUCHING
AND
PAUSING
THERE
I
CLOSED
MY
EYES
IN
A
LANGUOROUS
ECSTASY
AND
WAITED
WAITED
WITH
BEATINGHEART
BUT
AT
THAT
INSTANT
ANOTHER
SENSATION
SWEPT
THROUGH
ME
AS
QUICK
ASLIGHTNING
I
WAS
CONSCIOUS
OF
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
COUNT
AND
OF
HISBEING
AS
IF
LAPPED
IN
A
STORM
OF
FURY
AS
MY
EYES
OPENED
INVOLUNTARILY
ISAW
HIS
STRONG

TRANSFORMED
WITH

BUT
THE

NEVER
DID
I
IMAGINE
SUCH
WRATH
AND
FURY
EVEN
TOTHE
DEMONS
OF
THE
PIT
HIS
EYES
WERE
POSITIVELY
BLAZING
THE
RED
LIGHTIN

WAS
LURID
AS
IF
THE
FLAMES
OF
HELL
FIRE
BLAZED
BEHIND
THEM
HISFACE
WAS
DEATHLY
PALE
AND
THE
LINES
OF
IT
WERE
HARD
LIKE
DRAWN
WIRES
THE
THICK
EYEBROWS
THAT
MET
OVER
THE

NOW
SEEMED

WITH
A
FIERCE
SWEEP

HE
HURLED
THE
WOMANFROM
HIM
AND
THEN
MOTIONED
TO
THE

BACK
IT
WAS
THE

IMPERIOUS
GESTURE
THAT
I

IN
A
VOICE
WHICH
THOUGH
LOW
AND
ALMOST
IN
A
WHISPER
SEEMED

THROUGH

ITS
OWN
CALMS
MAY
THIS
MORNING
WHEN
I
WOKE
I
THOUGHT
I
WOULD
PROVIDE
MYSELFWITH
SOME
PAPER
AND
ENVELOPES
FROM
MY
BAG
AND
KEEP
THEM
IN
MY
POCKET
SOTHAT
I
MIGHT

SHOULD
GET
AN
OPPORTUNITY
BUT
AGAIN
ASURPRISE
AGAIN
A
SHOCK
EVERY
SCRAP
OF

WITH
IT
ALL
MY
NOTES
MY
MEMORANDA
RELATING
TO
RAILWAYS
AND
TRAVEL
MY
LETTER
OF
CREDIT
IN
FACT
ALL
THATMIGHT
BE
USEFUL
TO
ME
WERE
I
ONCE
OUTSIDE
THE
CASTLE
I
SAT
AND
PONDEREDAWHILE
AND
THEN
SOME
THOUGHT
OCCURRED
TO
ME
AND
I
MADE
SEARCH
OF
MYPORTMANTEAU
AND
IN
THE
WARDROBE
WHERE
I
HAD
PLACED
MY
CLOTHES
THE
SUIT
IN
WHICH
I
HAD
TRAVELLED
WAS
GONE
AND
ALSO
MY
OVERCOAT
ANDRUG
I
COULD
FIND
NO
TRACE
OF
THEM
ANYWHERE
THIS
LOOKED
LIKE
SOME
NEWSCHEME
OF
VILLAINY
JUNE
THIS
MORNING
AS
I
WAS
SITTING
ON
THE
EDGE
OF
MY
BEDCUDGELLING
MY
BRAINS
I
HEARD
WITHOUT
A
CRACKING
OF
WHIPS
AND
POUNDINGAND
SCRAPING
OF
HORSES
FEET
UP
THE
ROCKY
PATH
BEYOND
THE
COURTYARD
WITH
JOY
I
HURRIED
TO
THE
WINDOW
AND
SAW
DRIVE
INTO
THE
YARD
TWO
GREATLEITER
WAGONS
EACH
DRAWN
BY
EIGHT
STURDY
HORSES
AND
AT
THE
HEAD
OFEACH
PAIR
A
SLOVAK
WITH
HIS
WIDE
HAT
GREAT
NAIL
STUDDED
BELT
DIRTYSHEEPSKIN
AND
HIGH
BOOTS
THEY
HAD
ALSO
THEIR
LONG
STAVES
IN
HAND
IRAN
TO
THE
DOOR
INTENDING
TO
DESCEND
AND
TRY
AND
JOIN
THEM
THROUGH
THEMAIN
HALL
AS
I
THOUGHT
THAT
WAY
MIGHT
BE
OPENED
FOR
THEM
AGAIN
ASHOCK
MY
DOOR
WAS
FASTENED
ON
THE
OUTSIDE
THEN
I
RAN
TO
THE
WINDOW
AND
CRIED
TO
THEM
THEY
LOOKED
UP
AT
MESTUPIDLY
AND
POINTED
BUT
JUST
THEN
THE
HETMAN
OF
THE
SZGANY
CAME
OUT
AND
SEEING
THEM
POINTING
TO
MY
WINDOW
SAID
SOMETHING
AT
WHICH
THEYLAUGHED
HENCEFORTH
NO
EFFORT
OF
MINE
NO
PITEOUS
CRY
OR
AGONISEDENTREATY
WOULD
MAKE
THEM
EVEN
LOOK
AT
ME
THEY
RESOLUTELY
TURNED
AWAY
THE
LEITER
WAGONS
CONTAINED
GREAT
SQUARE
BOXES
WITH
HANDLES
OF
THICKROPE
THESE
WERE
EVIDENTLY
EMPTY
BY
THE
EASE
WITH
WHICH
THE
SLOVAKSHANDLED
THEM
AND
BY
THEIR
RESONANCE
AS
THEY
WERE
ROUGHLY
MOVED
WHENTHEY
WERE
ALL
UNLOADED
AND
PACKED
IN
A
GREAT
HEAP
IN
ONE
CORNER
OF
THEYARD
THE
SLOVAKS
WERE
GIVEN
SOME
MONEY
BY
THE
SZGANY
AND
SPITTING
ONIT
FOR
LUCK
LAZILY
WENT
EACH
TO
HIS
HORSE
S
HEAD
SHORTLY
AFTERWARDS
IHEARD
THE
CRACKING
OF
THEIR
WHIPS
DIE
AWAY
IN
THE
DISTANCE
JUNE
BEFORE
MORNING
LAST
NIGHT
THE
COUNT
LEFT
ME
EARLY
ANDLOCKED
HIMSELF
INTO
HIS
OWN
ROOM
AS
SOON
AS
I
DARED
I
RAN
UP
THEWINDING
STAIR
AND
LOOKED
OUT
OF
THE
WINDOW
WHICH
OPENED
SOUTH
ITHOUGHT
I
WOULD
WATCH
FOR
THE
COUNT
FOR
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
GOING
ON
THE
SZGANY
ARE
QUARTERED
SOMEWHERE
IN
THE
CASTLE
AND
ARE
DOING
WORK
OFSOME
KIND
I
KNOW
IT
FOR
NOW
AND
THEN
I
HEAR
A
FAR
AWAY
MUFFLED
SOUNDAS
OF
MATTOCK
AND
SPADE
AND
WHATEVER
IT
IS
IT
MUST
BE
THE
END
OF
SOMERUTHLESS
VILLAINY
I
HAD
BEEN
AT
THE
WINDOW
SOMEWHAT
LESS
THAN
HALF
AN
HOUR
WHEN
I
SAWSOMETHING
COMING
OUT
OF
THE
COUNT
S
WINDOW
I
DREW
BACK
AND
WATCHEDCAREFULLY
AND
SAW
THE
WHOLE
MAN
EMERGE
IT
WAS
A
NEW
SHOCK
TO
ME
TOFIND
THAT
HE
HAD
ON
THE
SUIT
OF
CLOTHES
WHICH
I
HAD
WORN
WHILSTTRAVELLING
HERE
AND
SLUNG
OVER
HIS
SHOULDER
THE
TERRIBLE
BAG
WHICH
IHAD
SEEN
THE
WOMEN
TAKE
AWAY
THERE
COULD
BE
NO
DOUBT
AS
TO
HIS
QUEST
AND
IN
MY
GARB
TOO
THIS
THEN
IS
HIS
NEW
SCHEME
OF
EVIL
THAT
HE
WILLALLOW
OTHERS
TO
SEE
ME
AS
THEY
THINK
SO
THAT
HE
MAY
BOTH
LEAVEEVIDENCE
THAT
I
HAVE
BEEN
SEEN
IN
THE
TOWNS
OR
VILLAGES
POSTING
MY
OWNLETTERS
AND
THAT
ANY
WICKEDNESS
WHICH
HE
MAY
DO
SHALL
BY
THE
LOCALPEOPLE
BE
ATTRIBUTED
TO
ME
IT
MAKES
ME
RAGE
TO
THINK
THAT
THIS
CAN
GO
ON
AND
WHILST
I
AM
SHUT
UPHERE
A
VERITABLE
PRISONER
BUT
WITHOUT
THAT
PROTECTION
OF
THE
LAW
WHICHIS
EVEN
A
CRIMINAL
S
RIGHT
AND
CONSOLATION
I
THOUGHT
I
WOULD
WATCH
FOR
THE
COUNT
S
RETURN
AND
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
SATDOGGEDLY
AT
THE
WINDOW
THEN
I
BEGAN
TO
NOTICE
THAT
THERE
WERE
SOMEQUAINT
LITTLE
SPECKS
FLOATING
IN
THE
RAYS
OF
THE
MOONLIGHT
THEY
WERELIKE
THE
TINIEST
GRAINS
OF
DUST
AND
THEY
WHIRLED
ROUND
AND
GATHERED
INCLUSTERS
IN
A
NEBULOUS
SORT
OF
WAY
I
WATCHED
THEM
WITH
A
SENSE
OFSOOTHING
AND
A
SORT
OF
CALM
STOLE
OVER
ME
I
LEANED
BACK
IN
THEEMBRASURE
IN
A
MORE
COMFORTABLE
POSITION
SO
THAT
I
COULD
ENJOY
MOREFULLY
THE
AERIAL
GAMBOLLING
SOMETHING
MADE
ME
START
UP
A
LOW
PITEOUS
HOWLING
OF
DOGS
SOMEWHERE
FARBELOW
IN
THE
VALLEY
WHICH
WAS
HIDDEN
FROM
MY
SIGHT
LOUDER
IT
SEEMED
TORING
IN
MY
EARS
AND
THE
FLOATING
MOTES
OF
DUST
TO
TAKE
NEW
SHAPES
TOTHE
SOUND
AS
THEY
DANCED
IN
THE
MOONLIGHT
I
FELT
MYSELF
STRUGGLING
TOAWAKE
TO
SOME
CALL
OF
MY
INSTINCTS
NAY
MY
VERY
SOUL
WAS
STRUGGLING
AND
MY
HALF
REMEMBERED
SENSIBILITIES
WERE
STRIVING
TO
ANSWER
THE
CALL
IWAS
BECOMING
HYPNOTISED
QUICKER
AND
QUICKER
DANCED
THE
DUST
THEMOONBEAMS
SEEMED
TO
QUIVER
AS
THEY
WENT
BY
ME
INTO
THE
MASS
OF
GLOOMBEYOND
MORE
AND
MORE
THEY
GATHERED
TILL
THEY
SEEMED
TO
TAKE
DIM
PHANTOMSHAPES
AND
THEN
I
STARTED
BROAD
AWAKE
AND
IN
FULL
POSSESSION
OF
MYSENSES
AND
RAN
SCREAMING
FROM
THE
PLACE
THE
PHANTOM
SHAPES
WHICH
WEREBECOMING
GRADUALLY
MATERIALISED
FROM
THE
MOONBEAMS
WERE
THOSE
OF
THETHREE
GHOSTLY
WOMEN
TO
WHOM
I
WAS
DOOMED
I
FLED
AND
FELT
SOMEWHATSAFER
IN
MY
OWN
ROOM
WHERE
THERE
WAS
NO
MOONLIGHT
AND
WHERE
THE
LAMPWAS
BURNING
BRIGHTLY
WHEN
A
COUPLE
OF
HOURS
HAD
PASSED
I
HEARD
SOMETHING
STIRRING
IN
THECOUNT
S
ROOM
SOMETHING
LIKE
A
SHARP
WAIL
QUICKLY
SUPPRESSED
AND
THENTHERE
WAS
SILENCE
DEEP
AWFUL
SILENCE
WHICH
CHILLED
ME
WITH
ABEATING
HEART
I
TRIED
THE
DOOR
BUT
I
WAS
LOCKED
IN
MY
PRISON
ANDCOULD
DO
NOTHING
I
SAT
DOWN
AND
SIMPLY
CRIED
AS
I
SAT
I
HEARD
A
SOUND
IN
THE
COURTYARD
WITHOUT
THE
AGONISED
CRY
OF
AWOMAN
I
RUSHED
TO
THE
WINDOW
AND
THROWING
IT
UP
PEERED
OUT
BETWEENTHE
BARS
THERE
INDEED
WAS
A
WOMAN
WITH
DISHEVELLED
HAIR
HOLDING
HERHANDS
OVER
HER
HEART
AS
ONE
DISTRESSED
WITH
RUNNING
SHE
WAS
LEANINGAGAINST
A
CORNER
OF
THE
GATEWAY
WHEN
SHE
SAW
MY
FACE
AT
THE
WINDOW
SHETHREW
HERSELF
FORWARD
AND
SHOUTED
IN
A
VOICE
LADEN
WITH
MENACE
MONSTER
GIVE
ME
MY
CHILD
SHE
THREW
HERSELF
ON
HER
KNEES
AND
RAISING
UP
HER
HANDS
CRIED
THE
SAMEWORDS
IN
TONES
WHICH
WRUNG
MY
HEART
THEN
SHE
TORE
HER
HAIR
AND
BEAT
HERBREAST
AND
ABANDONED
HERSELF
TO
ALL
THE
VIOLENCES
OF
EXTRAVAGANTEMOTION
FINALLY
SHE
THREW
HERSELF
FORWARD
AND
THOUGH
I
COULD
NOT
SEEHER
I
COULD
HEAR
THE
BEATING
OF
HER
NAKED
HANDS
AGAINST
THE
DOOR
SOMEWHERE
HIGH
OVERHEAD
PROBABLY
ON
THE
TOWER
I
HEARD
THE
VOICE
OF
THECOUNT
CALLING
IN
HIS
HARSH
METALLIC
WHISPER
HIS
CALL
SEEMED
TO
BEANSWERED
FROM
FAR
AND
WIDE
BY
THE
HOWLING
OF
WOLVES
BEFORE
MANY
MINUTESHAD
PASSED
A
PACK
OF
THEM
POURED
LIKE
A
PENT
UP
DAM
WHEN
LIBERATED
THROUGH
THE
WIDE
ENTRANCE
INTO
THE
COURTYARD
THERE
WAS
NO
CRY
FROM
THE
WOMAN
AND
THE
HOWLING
OF
THE
WOLVES
WAS
BUTSHORT
BEFORE
LONG
THEY
STREAMED
AWAY
SINGLY
LICKING
THEIR
LIPS
I
COULD
NOT
PITY
HER
FOR
I
KNEW
NOW
WHAT
HAD
BECOME
OF
HER
CHILD
ANDSHE
WAS
BETTER
DEAD
WHAT
SHALL
I
DO
WHAT
CAN

DO
HOW
CAN

HAS
SUFFERED
FROM
THE
NIGHTHOW
SWEET
AND
HOW
DEAR
TO
HIS
HEART
AND

BE
WHEN

GREW
SO
HIGH
THIS

THAT
IT
STRUCK
THE
TOP
OF
THE
GREATGATEWAY
OPPOSITE
MY

THE
HIGH
SPOT
WHICH
IT
TOUCHED
SEEMED
TO
MEAS
IF
THE
DOVE
FROM
THE
ARK
HAD
LIGHTED
THERE
MY
FEAR
FELL
FROM
ME
ASIF
IT
HAD
BEEN
A
VAPOROUS
GARMENT
WHICH
DISSOLVED
IN
THE
WARMTH
I
MUSTTAKE
ACTION
OF
SOME
SORT
WHILST
THE
COURAGE
OF
THE
DAY
IS
UPON
ME
LASTNIGHT

OF
MY
POST

OF
THAT
FATALSERIES

EFFORT
AND
GOD
HELPING
ME
HAVECOME
SAFELY
BACK
TO
THIS
ROOM
I
MUST
PUT
DOWN
EVERY
DETAIL
IN
ORDER
IWENT
WHILST
MY
COURAGE
WAS
FRESH
STRAIGHT
TO
THE
WINDOW
ON
THE
SOUTHSIDE
AND
AT
ONCE
GOT
OUTSIDE
ON
THE
NARROW
LEDGE
OF
STONE
WHICH
RUNSAROUND
THE
BUILDING
ON
THIS
SIDE
THE
STONES
ARE
BIG
AND
ROUGHLY
CUT
AND
THE
MORTAR
HAS
BY
PROCESS
OF
TIME
BEEN
WASHED
AWAY
BETWEEN
THEM
ITOOK
OFF
MY
BOOTS
AND
VENTURED
OUT
ON
THE
DESPERATE
WAY
I
LOOKED
DOWNONCE
SO
AS
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
A
SUDDEN
GLIMPSE
OF
THE
AWFUL
DEPTH
WOULDNOT
OVERCOME
ME
BUT
AFTER
THAT
KEPT
MY
EYES
AWAY
FROM
IT
I
KNEW
PRETTYWELL
THE
DIRECTION
AND
DISTANCE
OF
THE
COUNT
S
WINDOW
AND
MADE
FOR
ITAS
WELL
AS
I
COULD
HAVING
REGARD
TO
THE
OPPORTUNITIES
AVAILABLE
I
DIDNOT
FEEL
DIZZY
I
SUPPOSE
I
WAS
TOO
EXCITED
AND
THE
TIME
SEEMEDRIDICULOUSLY
SHORT
TILL
I
FOUND
MYSELF
STANDING
ON
THE
WINDOW
SILL
ANDTRYING
TO
RAISE
UP
THE
SASH
I
WAS
FILLED
WITH
AGITATION
HOWEVER
WHENI
BENT
DOWN
AND
SLID
FEET
FOREMOST
IN
THROUGH
THE
WINDOW
THEN
I
LOOKEDAROUND
FOR
THE
COUNT
BUT
WITH
SURPRISE
AND
GLADNESS
MADE
A
DISCOVERY
THE
ROOM
WAS
EMPTY
IT
WAS
BARELY
FURNISHED
WITH
ODD
THINGS
WHICHSEEMED
TO
HAVE
NEVER
BEEN
USED
THE
FURNITURE
WAS
SOMETHING
THE
SAMESTYLE
AS
THAT
IN
THE
SOUTH
ROOMS
AND
WAS
COVERED
WITH
DUST
I
LOOKEDFOR
THE
KEY
BUT
IT
WAS
NOT
IN
THE
LOCK
AND
I
COULD
NOT
FIND
ITANYWHERE
THE
ONLY
THING
I
FOUND
WAS
A
GREAT
HEAP
OF
GOLD
IN
ONECORNER
GOLD
OF
ALL
KINDS
ROMAN
AND
BRITISH
AND
AUSTRIAN
ANDHUNGARIAN
AND
GREEK
AND
TURKISH
MONEY
COVERED
WITH
A
FILM
OF
DUST
ASTHOUGH
IT
HAD
LAIN
LONG
IN
THE
GROUND
NONE
OF
IT
THAT
I
NOTICED
WASLESS
THAN
THREE
HUNDRED
YEARS
OLD
THERE
WERE
ALSO
CHAINS
AND
ORNAMENTS
SOME
JEWELLED
BUT
ALL
OF
THEM
OLD
AND
STAINED
AT
ONE
CORNER
OF
THE
ROOM
WAS
A
HEAVY
DOOR
I
TRIED
IT
FOR
SINCE
ICOULD
NOT
FIND
THE
KEY
OF
THE
ROOM
OR
THE
KEY
OF
THE
OUTER
DOOR
WHICHWAS
THE
MAIN
OBJECT
OF
MY
SEARCH
I
MUST
MAKE
FURTHER
EXAMINATION
ORALL
MY
EFFORTS
WOULD
BE
IN
VAIN
IT
WAS
OPEN
AND
LED
THROUGH
A
STONEPASSAGE
TO
A
CIRCULAR
STAIRWAY
WHICH
WENT
STEEPLY
DOWN
I
DESCENDED
MINDING
CAREFULLY
WHERE
I
WENT
FOR
THE
STAIRS
WERE
DARK
BEING
ONLY
LITBY
LOOPHOLES
IN
THE
HEAVY
MASONRY
AT
THE
BOTTOM
THERE
WAS
A
DARK
TUNNEL
LIKE
PASSAGE
THROUGH
WHICH
CAME
A
DEATHLY
SICKLY
ODOUR
THEODOUR
OF
OLD
EARTH
NEWLY
TURNED
AS
I
WENT
THROUGH
THE
PASSAGE
THE
SMELLGREW
CLOSER
AND
HEAVIER
AT
LAST
I
PULLED
OPEN
A
HEAVY
DOOR
WHICH
STOODAJAR
AND
FOUND
MYSELF
IN
AN
OLD
RUINED
CHAPEL
WHICH
HAD
EVIDENTLYBEEN
USED
AS
A
GRAVEYARD
THE
ROOF
WAS
BROKEN
AND
IN
TWO
PLACES
WERESTEPS
LEADING
TO
VAULTS
BUT
THE
GROUND
HAD
RECENTLY
BEEN
DUG
OVER
ANDTHE
EARTH
PLACED
IN
GREAT
WOODEN
BOXES
MANIFESTLY
THOSE
WHICH
HAD
BEENBROUGHT
BY
THE
SLOVAKS
THERE
WAS
NOBODY
ABOUT
AND
I
MADE
SEARCH
FORANY
FURTHER
OUTLET
BUT
THERE
WAS
NONE
THEN
I
WENT
OVER
EVERY
INCH
OFTHE
GROUND
SO
AS
NOT
TO
LOSE
A
CHANCE
I
WENT
DOWN
EVEN
INTO
THEVAULTS
WHERE
THE
DIM
LIGHT
STRUGGLED
ALTHOUGH
TO
DO
SO
WAS
A
DREAD
TOMY
VERY
SOUL
INTO
TWO
OF
THESE
I
WENT
BUT
SAW
NOTHING
EXCEPT
FRAGMENTSOF
OLD
COFFINS
AND
PILES
OF
DUST
IN
THE
THIRD
HOWEVER
I
MADE
ADISCOVERY
THERE
IN
ONE
OF
THE
GREAT
BOXES
OF
WHICH
THERE
WERE
FIFTY
IN
ALL
ON
APILE
OF
NEWLY
DUG
EARTH
LAY
THE
COUNT
HE
WAS
EITHER
DEAD
OR
ASLEEP
ICOULD
NOT
SAY
WHICH
FOR
THE
EYES
WERE
OPEN
AND
STONY
BUT
WITHOUT
THEGLASSINESS
OF
DEATH
AND
THE
CHEEKS
HAD
THE
WARMTH
OF
LIFE
THROUGH
ALLTHEIR
PALLOR
THE
LIPS
WERE
AS
RED
AS
EVER
BUT
THERE
WAS
NO
SIGN
OFMOVEMENT
NO
PULSE
NO
BREATH
NO
BEATING
OF
THE
HEART
I
BENT
OVER
HIM
AND
TRIED
TO
FIND
ANY
SIGN
OF
LIFE
BUT
IN
VAIN
HE
COULD
NOT
HAVE
LAINTHERE
LONG
FOR
THE
EARTHY
SMELL
WOULD
HAVE
PASSED
AWAY
IN
A
FEW
HOURS
BY
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
BOX
WAS
ITS
COVER
PIERCED
WITH
HOLES
HERE
AND
THERE
I
THOUGHT
HE
MIGHT
HAVE
THE
KEYS
ON
HIM
BUT
WHEN
I
WENT
TO
SEARCH
I
SAWTHE
DEAD
EYES
AND
IN
THEM
DEAD
THOUGH
THEY
WERE
SUCH
A
LOOK
OF
HATE
THOUGH
UNCONSCIOUS
OF
ME
OR
MY
PRESENCE
THAT
I
FLED
FROM
THE
PLACE
ANDLEAVING
THE
COUNT
S
ROOM
BY
THE
WINDOW
CRAWLED
AGAIN
UP
THE
CASTLEWALL
REGAINING
MY
ROOM
I
THREW
MYSELF
PANTING
UPON
THE
BED
AND
TRIEDTO
THINK
JUNE
TO
DAY
IS
THE
DATE
OF
MY
LAST
LETTER
AND
THE
COUNT
HASTAKEN
STEPS
TO
PROVE
THAT
IT
WAS
GENUINE
FOR
AGAIN
I
SAW
HIM
LEAVE
THECASTLE
BY
THE
SAME
WINDOW
AND
IN
MY
CLOTHES
AS
HE
WENT
DOWN
THE
WALL
LIZARD
FASHION
I
WISHED
I
HAD
A
GUN
OR
SOME
LETHAL
WEAPON
THAT
I
MIGHTDESTROY
HIM
BUT
I
FEAR
THAT
NO
WEAPON
WROUGHT
ALONE
BY
MAN
S
HAND
WOULDHAVE
ANY
EFFECT
ON
HIM
I
DARED
NOT
WAIT
TO

THOSE
WEIRD
SISTERS
I
CAME
BACK
TO
THE

I
WAS
AWAKENED
BY
THE
COUNT
WHO
LOOKED
AT

AS
GRIMLY
AS

AS
HE
SAID
TO

I
SUSPECTED
HIM
AND
DETERMINED
TO
TEST
HIS
SINCERITY
SINCERITY
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
A
PROFANATION
OF
THE
WORD
TO
WRITE
IT
INCONNECTION
WITH
SUCH
A
MONSTER
SO
ASKED
HIM
POINT
BLANK
WHY
MAY
I
NOT

WALK
WITH
PLEASURE
I
WANT

HE
SMILED
SUCH
A
SOFT
SMOOTH
DIABOLICAL
SMILE
THAT
I
KNEW

SOME
TRICKBEHIND
HIS

SAID
AND
YOUR

I
DO
NOT

ABOUT
IT

WITH
A
STATELY
GRAVITY
HE
WITH
THELAMP
PRECEDED
ME
DOWN
THE
STAIRS
AND
ALONG
THE
HALL
SUDDENLY
HESTOPPED
HARK
CLOSE
AT
HAND
CAME
THE
HOWLING
OF
MANY
WOLVES
IT
WAS
ALMOST
AS
IF
THESOUND
SPRANG
UP
AT
THE
RISING
OF
HIS
HAND
JUST
AS
THE
MUSIC
OF
A
GREATORCHESTRA
SEEMS
TO
LEAP
UNDER
THE
BATON
OF
THE
CONDUCTOR
AFTER
A
PAUSEOF
A
MOMENT
HE
PROCEEDED
IN
HIS
STATELY
WAY
TO
THE
DOOR
DREW
BACKTHE
PONDEROUS
BOLTS
UNHOOKED
THE
HEAVY
CHAINS
AND
BEGAN
TO
DRAW
ITOPEN
TO
MY
INTENSE
ASTONISHMENT
I
SAW
THAT
IT
WAS
UNLOCKED
SUSPICIOUSLY
ILOOKED
ALL
ROUND
BUT
COULD
SEE
NO
KEY
OF
ANY
KIND
AS
THE
DOOR
BEGAN
TO
OPEN
THE
HOWLING
OF
THE
WOLVES
WITHOUT
GREW
LOUDERAND
ANGRIER
THEIR
RED
JAWS
WITH
CHAMPING
TEETH
AND
THEIR
BLUNT
CLAWEDFEET
AS
THEY
LEAPED
CAME
IN
THROUGH
THE
OPENING
DOOR
I
KNEW
THEN
THATTO
STRUGGLE
AT
THE
MOMENT
AGAINST
THE
COUNT
WAS
USELESS
WITH
SUCHALLIES
AS
THESE
AT
HIS
COMMAND
I
COULD
DO
NOTHING
BUT
STILL
THE
DOORCONTINUED
SLOWLY
TO
OPEN
AND
ONLY
THE
COUNT
S
BODY
STOOD
IN
THE
GAP
SUDDENLY
IT
STRUCK
ME
THAT
THIS
MIGHT
BE
THE
MOMENT
AND
MEANS
OF
MYDOOM
I
WAS
TO
BE
GIVEN
TO
THE
WOLVES
AND
AT
MY
OWN
INSTIGATION
THEREWAS
A
DIABOLICAL
WICKEDNESS
IN
THE
IDEA
GREAT
ENOUGH
FOR
THE
COUNT
ANDAS
A
LAST
CHANCE
I
CRIED
OUT
SHUT
THE
DOOR
I
SHALL
WAIT
TILL
MORNING
AND
COVERED
MY
FACE
WITH
MYHANDS
TO
HIDE
MY
TEARS
OF
BITTER
DISAPPOINTMENT
WITH
ONE
SWEEP
OF
HISPOWERFUL
ARM
THE
COUNT
THREW
THE
DOOR
SHUT
AND
THE
GREAT
BOLTS
CLANGEDAND
ECHOED
THROUGH
THE
HALL
AS
THEY
SHOT
BACK
INTO
THEIR
PLACES
IN
SILENCE
WE
RETURNED
TO
THE
LIBRARY
AND
AFTER
A
MINUTE
OR
TWO
I
WENTTO
MY
OWN
ROOM
THE
LAST
I
SAW
OF
COUNT
DRACULA
WAS
HIS
KISSING
HIS
HANDTO
ME
WITH
A
RED
LIGHT
OF
TRIUMPH
IN
HIS
EYES
AND
WITH
A
SMILE
THATJUDAS
IN
HELL
MIGHT
BE
PROUD
OF
WHEN
I
WAS
IN
MY
ROOM
AND
ABOUT
TO
LIE
DOWN
I
THOUGHT
I

AWHISPERING
AT

WENT
TO

SOFTLY
AND

SUBTLE
CHANGE
IN

AND
KNEW
THAT
THE

CAME
THE
WELCOME
COCK

AND
I
FELT
THAT

AND
RAN

TILL
MASSIVE
AS

WAS
IT
RATTLED
IN
ITSCASEMENT
I
COULD
SEE
THE
BOLT
SHOT
IT
HAD
BEEN

AFTER
I
LEFT

THEN
A
WILD
DESIRE
TOOK
ME
TO
OBTAIN
THAT
KEY
AT
ANY

AND
IDETERMINED
THEN
AND
THERE
TO
SCALE
THE

AGAIN
AND
GAIN
THE

SROOM
HE
MIGHT
KILL
ME
BUT
DEATH
NOW
SEEMED
THE
HAPPIER
CHOICE
OFEVILS
WITHOUT
A

I
RUSHED
UP
TO
THE
EAST
WINDOW
AND
SCRAMBLEDDOWN
THE

AS

INTO
THE

ROOM
IT
WAS
EMPTY
BUT
THATWAS
AS
I
EXPECTED
I
COULD
NOT

ANYWHERE
BUT
THE

OF
GOLDREMAINED
I
WENT
THROUGH
THE
DOOR
IN
THE
CORNER
AND
DOWN
THE
WINDINGSTAIR
AND
ALONG
THE
DARK
PASSAGE
TO
THE
OLD
CHAPEL
I
KNEW
NOW
WELLENOUGH
WHERE
TO
FIND
THE
MONSTER
I
SOUGHT
THE
GREAT
BOX
WAS
IN
THE
SAME
PLACE
CLOSE
AGAINST
THE

BUT
THE
LIDWAS
LAID
ON
IT
NOT
FASTENED
DOWN
BUT
WITH
THE
NAILS
READY
IN
THEIRPLACES
TO
BE
HAMMERED
HOME
I
KNEW
I
MUST
REACH
THE
BODY
FOR
THE
KEY
SOI
RAISED
THE
LID
AND
LAID
IT
BACK
AGAINST
THE
WALL
AND
THEN
I
SAWSOMETHING
WHICH
FILLED
MY
VERY
SOUL
WITH
HORROR
THERE
LAY
THE
COUNT
BUT
LOOKING
AS
IF
HIS
YOUTH
HAD
BEEN
HALF
RENEWED
FOR
THE
WHITE
HAIRAND

WERE
CHANGED
TO
DARK
IRON
GREY
THE

FULLER
AND
THE

SEEMED
RUBY
RED
UNDERNEATH
THE
MOUTH
WAS
REDDER
THANEVER
FOR
ON
THE
LIPS
WERE
GOUTS
OF
FRESH
BLOOD
WHICH
TRICKLED
FROM
THECORNERS
OF
THE
MOUTH
AND
RAN
OVER
THE
CHIN
AND
NECK
EVEN
THE
DEEP
BURNING
EYES
SEEMED
SET
AMONGST
SWOLLEN
FLESH
FOR
THE
LIDS
AND

WERE
BLOATED
IT
SEEMED
AS
IF
THE

AWFUL
CREATURE
WERESIMPLY
GORGED
WITH

HE
LAY
LIKE
A
FILTHY
LEECH
EXHAUSTED
WITH
HISREPLETION
I
SHUDDERED
AS
I
BENT
OVER
TO
TOUCH
HIM
AND
EVERY
SENSE
INME
REVOLTED
AT
THE
CONTACT
BUT
I
HAD
TO
SEARCH
OR
I
WAS
LOST
THECOMING
NIGHT
MIGHT
SEE
MY

BODY
A
BANQUET
IN
A
SIMILAR
WAY
TO
THOSEHORRID
THREE
I
FELT
ALL
OVER
THE
BODY
BUT
NO
SIGN
COULD
I
FIND
OF
THEKEY
THEN
I
STOPPED
AND
LOOKED
AT
THE
COUNT
THERE
WAS
A
MOCKING
SMILEON
THE
BLOATED
FACE
WHICH
SEEMED
TO
DRIVE
ME
MAD
THIS
WAS
THE
BEING
IWAS
HELPING
TO

TO
LONDON
WHERE
PERHAPS
FOR
CENTURIES
TO

THE
VERY
THOUGHT
DROVE
ME
MAD
A
TERRIBLE
DESIRE
CAME
UPON
METO
RID
THE
WORLD
OF
SUCH
A
MONSTER
THERE
WAS
NO
LETHAL
WEAPON
AT
HAND
BUT
I
SEIZED
A
SHOVEL
WHICH
THE
WORKMEN
HAD
BEEN
USING
TO
FILL
THECASES
AND
LIFTING
IT
HIGH
STRUCK
WITH
THE
EDGE
DOWNWARD
AT
THEHATEFUL
FACE
BUT
AS
I
DID
SO
THE
HEAD
TURNED
AND
THE
EYES
FELL
FULLUPON
ME
WITH
ALL
THEIR
BLAZE
OF
BASILISK
HORROR
THE
SIGHT
SEEMED
TOPARALYSE
ME
AND
THE
SHOVEL
TURNED
IN
MY
HAND
AND
GLANCED
FROM
THE
FACE
MERELY
MAKING
A
DEEP
GASH
ABOVE
THE
FOREHEAD
THE
SHOVEL
FELL
FROM
MYHAND
ACROSS
THE
BOX
AND
AS
I
PULLED
IT
AWAY
THE
FLANGE
OF
THE
BLADECAUGHT
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
LID
WHICH
FELL
OVER
AGAIN
AND
HID
THE
HORRIDTHING
FROM
MY
SIGHT
THE
LAST
GLIMPSE
I
HAD
WAS
OF
THE
BLOATED
FACE
BLOOD
STAINED
AND
FIXED
WITH
A
GRIN
OF
MALICE
WHICH
WOULD
HAVE
HELD
ITSOWN
IN
THE
NETHERMOST
HELL
I
THOUGHT
AND
THOUGHT
WHAT
SHOULD
BE
MY
NEXT
MOVE
BUT
MY
BRAIN
SEEMEDON
FIRE
AND
I
WAITED
WITH
A
DESPAIRING
FEELING
GROWING
OVER
ME
AS
IWAITED
I
HEARD
IN
THE
DISTANCE
A
GIPSY
SONG
SUNG
BY
MERRY
VOICES
COMINGCLOSER
AND
THROUGH
THEIR
SONG
THE
ROLLING
OF
HEAVY
WHEELS
AND
THECRACKING
OF
WHIPS
THE
SZGANY
AND
THE
SLOVAKS
OF
WHOM
THE
COUNT
HADSPOKEN
WERE
COMING
WITH
A
LAST
LOOK
AROUND
AND
AT
THE
BOX
WHICHCONTAINED
THE
VILE
BODY
I
RAN
FROM
THE
PLACE
AND
GAINED
THE
COUNT
SROOM
DETERMINED
TO
RUSH
OUT
AT
THE
MOMENT
THE
DOOR
SHOULD
BE
OPENED
WITH
STRAINED
EARS
I
LISTENED
AND
HEARD
DOWNSTAIRS
THE
GRINDING
OF
THEKEY
IN
THE
GREAT
LOCK
AND
THE
FALLING
BACK
OF
THE
HEAVY
DOOR
THERE
MUSTHAVE
BEEN
SOME
OTHER
MEANS
OF
ENTRY
OR
SOME
ONE
HAD
A
KEY
FOR
ONE
OFTHE
LOCKED
DOORS
THEN
THERE
CAME
THE
SOUND
OF
MANY
FEET
TRAMPING
ANDDYING
AWAY
IN
SOME
PASSAGE
WHICH
SENT
UP
A
CLANGING
ECHO
I
TURNED
TORUN
DOWN
AGAIN
TOWARDS
THE
VAULT
WHERE
I
MIGHT
FIND
THE
NEW
ENTRANCE
BUT
AT
THE
MOMENT
THERE
SEEMED
TO
COME
A
VIOLENT
PUFF
OF
WIND
AND
THEDOOR
TO
THE
WINDING
STAIR
BLEW
TO
WITH
A
SHOCK
THAT
SET
THE
DUST
FROMTHE
LINTELS
FLYING
WHEN
I
RAN
TO
PUSH
IT
OPEN
I
FOUND
THAT
IT
WASHOPELESSLY
FAST
I
WAS
AGAIN
A
PRISONER
AND
THE
NET
OF
DOOM
WAS
CLOSINGROUND
ME
MORE
CLOSELY
AS
I
WRITE
THERE
IS
IN
THE
PASSAGE
BELOW
A
SOUND
OF
MANY
TRAMPING
FEETAND
THE
CRASH
OF
WEIGHTS
BEING
SET
DOWN
HEAVILY
DOUBTLESS
THE
BOXES
WITH
THEIR
FREIGHT
OF

THERE
IS
A
SOUND
OF
HAMMERING
IT
IS
THEBOX
BEING
NAILED
DOWN
NOW
I
CAN
HEAR
THE
HEAVY

THE

HARK
IN
THE

AND
DOWN
THE

THE

OF
HEAVY

THE

COOLOUTWARDLY
BUT
WAS
NERVOUS
ALL
THE
SAME
HE
HAD
EVIDENTLY
BEEN
SCHOOLINGHIMSELF
AS
TO
ALL
SORTS
OF
LITTLE
THINGS
AND
REMEMBERED
THEM
BUT
HEALMOST
MANAGED
TO
SIT
DOWN
ON
HIS
SILK
HAT
WHICH
MEN
DON
T
GENERALLY
DOWHEN
THEY
ARE
COOL
AND
THEN
WHEN
HE
WANTED
TO
APPEAR
AT

HE
KEPTPLAYING
WITH
A
LANCET
IN
A
WAY
THAT
MADE
ME
NEARLY
SCREAM
HE

TOME
MINA
VERY
STRAIGHTFORWARDLY
HE
TOLD

HOW

CRY
HE
SAID

A
BRUTEAND

VERY
NICELY
SAYING
THAT
HE

NOT

MYHANDS
IN
HIS

SYMPATHISEWITH
POOR

WHEN

TO

WE

TO
THE

AT
THE

INWHICH
THEY

THIS
IS
A
LOVELY
PLACE
THE

THEESK
RUNS
THROUGH
A
DEEP
VALLEY
WHICH
BROADENS
OUT
AS
IT
COMES
NEAR
THEHARBOUR
A
GREAT
VIADUCT

ACROSS
WITH
HIGH

THROUGH
WHICH
THEVIEW
SEEMS
SOMEHOW
FURTHER
AWAY
THAN
IT
REALLY
IS
THE
VALLEY
ISBEAUTIFULLY
GREEN
AND
IT
IS
SO
STEEP
THAT
WHEN
YOU

EITHER

UNLESS

ANYHOW
LIKE
THEPICTURES
WE

RIGHT
OVER
THE
TOWN
IS
THE
RUIN
OF
WHITBYABBEY
WHICH
WAS
SACKED
BY
THE
DANES
AND
WHICH
IS
THE
SCENE
OF
PART
OF
MARMION
WHERE
THE
GIRL
WAS
BUILT
UP
IN
THE
WALL
IT
IS
A
MOST
NOBLERUIN
OF
IMMENSE
SIZE
AND
FULL
OF
BEAUTIFUL
AND
ROMANTIC
BITS
THERE
ISA
LEGEND
THAT
A
WHITE

IS
SEEN
IN

THERE
IS
ANOTHER
CHURCH
THE
PARISH
ONE
ROUND
WHICH
IS
A
BIGGRAVEYARD
ALL
FULL
OF
TOMBSTONES
THIS
IS
TO
MY
MIND
THE
NICEST
SPOT
INWHITBY
FOR
IT
LIES
RIGHT
OVER
THE
TOWN
AND
HAS
A
FULL
VIEW
OF
THEHARBOUR
AND
ALL
UP
THE
BAY
TO
WHERE
THE
HEADLAND
CALLED

OUT
INTO

IT
DESCENDS
SO
STEEPLY
OVER

THATPART
OF
THE

HAS
FALLEN

ARE

ALL

LONGLOOKING
AT

VERY
OFTEN
MYSELF

INDEED
I
AM
WRITING

SEEM
TO
DO
NOTHING
ALL

BUT
SIT
UP
HERE
ANDTALK
THE

LIES
BELOW
ME
WITH
ON
THE
FAR
SIDE
ONE
LONG
GRANITE
WALLSTRETCHING
OUT
INTO
THE
SEA
WITH
A
CURVE
OUTWARDS
AT
THE
END
OF
IT
INTHE
MIDDLE
OF
WHICH
IS
A
LIGHTHOUSE
A
HEAVY
SEA
WALL
RUNS
ALONG
OUTSIDEOF
IT
ON
THE
NEAR
SIDE
THE
SEA
WALL
MAKES
AN
ELBOW
CROOKED
INVERSELY
AND
ITS
END
TOO
HAS
A
LIGHTHOUSE
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
PIERS
THERE
IS
ANARROW
OPENING
INTO
THE
HARBOUR
WHICH
THEN
SUDDENLY
WIDENS
IT
IS
NICE
AT
HIGH
WATER
BUT
WHEN
THE
TIDE
IS
OUT
IT
SHOALS
AWAY
TONOTHING
AND
THERE
IS
MERELY
THE
STREAM
OF
THE
ESK
RUNNING
BETWEENBANKS
OF
SAND
WITH
ROCKS
HERE
AND
THERE
OUTSIDE
THE
HARBOUR
ON
THISSIDE
THERE
RISES
FOR
ABOUT
HALF
A
MILE
A
GREAT
REEF
THE
SHARP
EDGE
OFWHICH
RUNS
STRAIGHT
OUT
FROM
BEHIND
THE
SOUTH
LIGHTHOUSE
AT
THE
END
OFIT
IS
A
BUOY
WITH
A
BELL
WHICH
SWINGS
IN
BAD
WEATHER
AND
SENDS
IN
AMOURNFUL
SOUND
ON
THE
WIND
THEY
HAVE
A
LEGEND
HERE
THAT
WHEN
A
SHIP
ISLOST

THAT
HE
WAS
A
SAILOR
IN
THE
GREENLAND
FISHINGFLEET
WHEN
WATERLOO
WAS
FOUGHT
HE
IS
I
AM
AFRAID
A
VERY
SCEPTICALPERSON
FOR
WHEN
I
ASKED
HIM
ABOUT
THE
BELLS
AT

AND
THE

OFFOOL

I
THOUGHT

FROM
SO
I
ASKED

MIND
TELLING
ME

ABOUTTHE

SAIRLY
BY

HIM
HURRYING
AS

COULD
DOWNTHE
STEPS
THE
STEPS
ARE
A
GREAT
FEATURE
ON
THE
PLACE
THEY
LEAD
FROMTHE
TOWN
UP
TO
THE
CHURCH
THERE
ARE
HUNDREDS
OF
THEM
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
HOWMANY
AND
THEY
WIND
UP
IN
A
DELICATE
CURVE
THE
SLOPE
IS
SO
GENTLE
THATA
HORSE
COULD
EASILY
WALK
UP
AND
DOWN
THEM
I
THINK
THEY

ORIGINALLYHAVE
HAD
SOMETHING
TO

WITH
THE
ABBEY

EVIDENTLY
THE
SIR
ORACLE

THINKMUST
HAVE

DICTATORIAL
PERSON
HE
WILL
NOT
ADMITANYTHING

DOWNFACES
EVERYBODY
IF
HE

IN
COMING
UP

SITTING
NEAR
HER
WHEN
WE
SAT
DOWN
SHE

THE

DAY
I
CAME
UP
HERE
ALONE
FOR
I
AM
VERY
SAD
THERE
WAS
NOLETTER
FOR
ME
I
HOPE
THERE
CANNOT
BE
ANYTHING
THE
MATTER
WITH
JONATHAN
THE
CLOCK
HAS
JUST
STRUCK
NINE
I
SEE
THE
LIGHTS
SCATTERED
ALL
OVER
THETOWN
SOMETIMES
IN

WHERE
THE
STREETS
ARE
AND
SOMETIMES
SINGLY
THEY
RUN
RIGHT
UP
THE

AND
DIE
AWAY
IN
THE
CURVE
OF
THE

THE

OFF
BY
A

OF

OF
THE

NEXTTHE

AND
LAMBS
ARE
BLEATING
IN
THE
FIELDS
AWAY
BEHINDME
AND
THERE
IS
A
CLATTER
OF
A
DONKEY
S
HOOFS
UP
THE
PAVED
ROAD
BELOW
THE

ON
THE

IS
PLAYING
A
HARSH
WALTZ
IN

NEITHER

BUT
UP
HERE
I
HEAR
AND
SEE
THEMBOTH
I
WONDER
WHERE
JONATHAN
IS
AND
IF
HE
IS
THINKING
OF
ME
I
WISH
HEWERE
HERE
DR
SEWARD
S
DIARY
JUNE
THE
CASE
OF
RENFIELD
GROWS
MORE
INTERESTING
THE
MORE
I
GET
TOUNDERSTAND
THE
MAN
HE
HAS
CERTAIN
QUALITIES
VERY
LARGELY
DEVELOPED
SELFISHNESS
SECRECY
AND
PURPOSE
I
WISH
I
COULD
GET
AT
WHAT
IS
THEOBJECT
OF
THE
LATTER
HE
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
SOME
SETTLED
SCHEME
OF
HIS
OWN
BUT
WHAT
IT
IS
I
DO
NOT
YET
KNOW
HIS
REDEEMING
QUALITY
IS
A
LOVE
OFANIMALS
THOUGH
INDEED
HE
HAS
SUCH
CURIOUS
TURNS
IN
IT
THAT
ISOMETIMES
IMAGINE
HE
IS
ONLY
ABNORMALLY
CRUEL
HIS
PETS
ARE
OF
ODDSORTS
JUST
NOW
HIS
HOBBY
IS
CATCHING
FLIES
HE
HAS
AT
PRESENT
SUCH
AQUANTITY
THAT
I
HAVE
HAD
MYSELF
TO
EXPOSTULATE
TO
MY
ASTONISHMENT
HEDID
NOT
BREAK
OUT
INTO
A
FURY
AS
I
EXPECTED
BUT
TOOK
THE
MATTER
INSIMPLE
SERIOUSNESS
HE
THOUGHT
FOR
A
MOMENT
AND
THEN
SAID
MAY
I
HAVETHREE
DAYS
I
SHALL
CLEAR
THEM
AWAY
OF
COURSE
I
SAID
THAT
WOULD
DO
IMUST
WATCH
HIM
JUNE
HE
HAS
TURNED
HIS
MIND
NOW
TO
SPIDERS
AND
HAS
GOT
SEVERALVERY
BIG
FELLOWS
IN
A
BOX
HE
KEEPS
FEEDING
THEM
WITH
HIS
FLIES
ANDTHE
NUMBER
OF
THE
LATTER
IS
BECOMING
SENSIBLY
DIMINISHED
ALTHOUGH
HEHAS
USED
HALF
HIS
FOOD
IN
ATTRACTING
MORE
FLIES
FROM
OUTSIDE
TO
HISROOM
JULY
HIS
SPIDERS
ARE
NOW
BECOMING
AS
GREAT
A
NUISANCE
AS
HISFLIES
AND
TO
DAY
I
TOLD
HIM
THAT
HE
MUST
GET
RID
OF
THEM
HE
LOOKEDVERY
SAD
AT
THIS
SO
I
SAID
THAT
HE
MUST
CLEAR
OUT
SOME
OF
THEM
AT
ALLEVENTS
HE
CHEERFULLY
ACQUIESCED
IN
THIS
AND
I
GAVE
HIM
THE
SAME
TIMEAS
BEFORE
FOR
REDUCTION
HE
DISGUSTED
ME
MUCH
WHILE
WITH
HIM
FOR
WHEN
AHORRID
BLOW
FLY
BLOATED
WITH
SOME
CARRION
FOOD
BUZZED
INTO
THE
ROOM
HE
CAUGHT
IT
HELD
IT
EXULTANTLY
FOR
A
FEW
MOMENTS
BETWEEN
HIS
FINGERAND
THUMB
AND
BEFORE
I
KNEW
WHAT
HE
WAS
GOING
TO
DO
PUT
IT
IN
HISMOUTH
AND
ATE
IT
I
SCOLDED
HIM
FOR
IT
BUT
HE
ARGUED
QUIETLY
THAT
ITWAS
VERY
GOOD
AND
VERY
WHOLESOME
THAT
IT
WAS
LIFE
STRONG
LIFE
ANDGAVE
LIFE
TO
HIM
THIS
GAVE
ME
AN
IDEA
OR
THE
RUDIMENT
OF
ONE
I
MUSTWATCH
HOW
HE
GETS
RID
OF
HIS
SPIDERS
HE
HAS
EVIDENTLY
SOME
DEEP
PROBLEMIN
HIS
MIND
FOR
HE
KEEPS
A
LITTLE
NOTE
BOOK
IN
WHICH
HE
IS
ALWAYSJOTTING
DOWN
SOMETHING
WHOLE
PAGES
OF
IT
ARE
FILLED
WITH
MASSES
OFFIGURES
GENERALLY
SINGLE
NUMBERS
ADDED
UP
IN
BATCHES
AND
THEN
THETOTALS
ADDED
IN
BATCHES
AGAIN
AS
THOUGH
HE
WERE
FOCUSSING
SOMEACCOUNT
AS
THE
AUDITORS
PUT
IT
JULY
THERE
IS
A
METHOD
IN
HIS
MADNESS
AND
THE
RUDIMENTARY
IDEA
INMY
MIND
IS
GROWING
IT
WILL
BE
A
WHOLE
IDEA
SOON
AND
THEN
OH
UNCONSCIOUS
CEREBRATION
YOU
WILL
HAVE
TO
GIVE
THE
WALL
TO
YOURCONSCIOUS
BROTHER
I
KEPT
AWAY
FROM
MY
FRIEND
FOR
A
FEW
DAYS
SO
THAT
IMIGHT
NOTICE
IF
THERE
WERE
ANY
CHANGE
THINGS
REMAIN
AS
THEY
WERE
EXCEPTTHAT
HE
HAS
PARTED
WITH
SOME
OF
HIS
PETS
AND
GOT
A
NEW
ONE
HE
HASMANAGED
TO
GET
A
SPARROW
AND
HAS
ALREADY
PARTIALLY
TAMED
IT
HIS
MEANSOF
TAMING
IS
SIMPLE
FOR
ALREADY
THE
SPIDERS
HAVE
DIMINISHED
THOSE
THATDO
REMAIN
HOWEVER
ARE
WELL
FED
FOR
HE
STILL
BRINGS
IN
THE
FLIES
BYTEMPTING
THEM
WITH
HIS
FOOD
JULY
WE
ARE
PROGRESSING
MY
FRIEND
HAS
NOW
A
WHOLE
COLONY
OFSPARROWS
AND
HIS
FLIES
AND
SPIDERS
ARE
ALMOST
OBLITERATED
WHEN
I
CAMEIN
HE
RAN
TO
ME
AND
SAID
HE
WANTED
TO
ASK
ME
A
GREAT
FAVOUR
A
VERY
VERY
GREAT
FAVOUR
AND
AS
HE
SPOKE
HE
FAWNED
ON
ME
LIKE
A
DOG
I
ASKEDHIM
WHAT
IT
WAS
AND
HE
SAID
WITH
A
SORT
OF
RAPTURE
IN
HIS
VOICE
ANDBEARING
A
KITTEN
A
NICE
LITTLE
SLEEK
PLAYFUL
KITTEN
THAT
I
CAN
PLAY
WITH
AND
TEACH
AND
FEED
AND
FEED
AND
FEED
I
WAS
NOT
UNPREPARED
FOR
THISREQUEST
FOR
I
HAD
NOTICED
HOW
HIS
PETS
WENT
ON
INCREASING
IN
SIZE
ANDVIVACITY
BUT
I
DID
NOT
CARE
THAT
HIS
PRETTY
FAMILY
OF
TAME
SPARROWSSHOULD
BE
WIPED
OUT
IN
THE
SAME
MANNER
AS
THE
FLIES
AND
THE
SPIDERS
SOI
SAID
I
WOULD
SEE
ABOUT
IT
AND
ASKED
HIM
IF
HE
WOULD
NOT
RATHER
HAVE
ACAT
THAN
A
KITTEN
HIS
EAGERNESS
BETRAYED
HIM
AS
HE
ANSWERED
OH
YES
I
WOULD
LIKE
A
CAT
I
ONLY
ASKED
FOR
A
KITTEN
LEST
YOU
SHOULDREFUSE
ME
A
CAT
NO

WOULD
REFUSE
ME
A
KITTEN
WOULD
THEY
I
SHOOKMY
HEAD
AND
SAID
THAT
AT
PRESENT
I
FEARED
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
POSSIBLE
BUTTHAT
I
WOULD
SEE
ABOUT
IT
HIS
FACE
FELL
AND
I
COULD
SEE
A
WARNING
OFDANGER
IN
IT
FOR
THERE
WAS
A
SUDDEN
FIERCE
SIDELONG
LOOK
WHICH
MEANTKILLING
THE
MAN
IS
AN
UNDEVELOPED
HOMICIDAL
MANIAC
I
SHALL
TEST
HIMWITH
HIS
PRESENT
CRAVING
AND
SEE
HOW
IT
WILL
WORK
OUT
THEN
I
SHALL
KNOWMORE
P
M
I
HAVE
VISITED
HIM
AGAIN
AND
FOUND
HIM
SITTING
IN
A
CORNERBROODING
WHEN
I
CAME
IN
HE
THREW
HIMSELF
ON
HIS
KNEES
BEFORE
ME
ANDIMPLORED
ME
TO
LET
HIM
HAVE
A
CAT
THAT
HIS
SALVATION
DEPENDED
UPON
IT
I
WAS
FIRM
HOWEVER
AND
TOLD
HIM
THAT
HE
COULD
NOT
HAVE
IT
WHEREUPONHE
WENT
WITHOUT
A
WORD
AND
SAT
DOWN
GNAWING
HIS
FINGERS
IN
THE
CORNERWHERE
I
HAD
FOUND
HIM
I
SHALL
SEE
HIM
IN
THE
MORNING
EARLY
JULY
VISITED
RENFIELD
VERY
EARLY
BEFORE
THE
ATTENDANT
WENT
HISROUNDS
FOUND
HIM
UP
AND
HUMMING
A
TUNE
HE
WAS
SPREADING
OUT
HIS
SUGAR
WHICH
HE
HAD
SAVED
IN
THE
WINDOW
AND
WAS
MANIFESTLY
BEGINNING
HISFLY
CATCHING
AGAIN
AND
BEGINNING
IT
CHEERFULLY
AND
WITH
A
GOOD
GRACE
ILOOKED
AROUND
FOR
HIS
BIRDS
AND
NOT
SEEING
THEM
ASKED
HIM
WHERE
THEYWERE
HE
REPLIED
WITHOUT
TURNING
ROUND
THAT
THEY
HAD
ALL
FLOWN
AWAY
THERE
WERE
A
FEW
FEATHERS
ABOUT
THE
ROOM
AND
ON
HIS
PILLOW
A
DROP
OFBLOOD
I
SAID
NOTHING
BUT
WENT
AND
TOLD
THE
KEEPER
TO
REPORT
TO
ME
IFTHERE
WERE
ANYTHING
ODD
ABOUT
HIM
DURING
THE
DAY
A
M
THE
ATTENDANT
HAS
JUST
BEEN
TO
ME
TO
SAY
THAT
RENFIELD
HASBEEN
VERY
SICK
AND
HAS
DISGORGED
A
WHOLE
LOT
OF
FEATHERS
MY
BELIEF
IS
DOCTOR
HE
SAID
THAT
HE
HAS
EATEN
HIS
BIRDS
AND
THAT
HE
JUST
TOOKAND
ATE
THEM
RAW
P
M
I
GAVE
RENFIELD
A
STRONG
OPIATE
TO
NIGHT
ENOUGH
TO
MAKEEVEN
HIM
SLEEP
AND
TOOK
AWAY
HIS
POCKET
BOOK
TO
LOOK
AT
IT
THE
THOUGHTTHAT
HAS
BEEN
BUZZING
ABOUT
MY

LATELY
IS
COMPLETE
AND
THE
THEORYPROVED
MY

IS
OF
A
PECULIAR
KIND
I
SHALL
HAVE
TOINVENT
A
NEW
CLASSIFICATION
FOR
HIM
AND
CALL
HIM
A
ZOOPHAGOUS
LIFE
EATING
MANIAC
WHAT
HE
DESIRES
IS
TO
ABSORB
AS
MANY
LIVES
AS
HECAN
AND
HE
HAS
LAID
HIMSELF
OUT
TO
ACHIEVE
IT
IN
A
CUMULATIVE
WAY
HEGAVE
MANY
FLIES
TO
ONE
SPIDER
AND
MANY
SPIDERS
TO
ONE
BIRD
AND
THENWANTED
A
CAT
TO
EAT
THE
MANY
BIRDS
WHAT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN

UNHAPPY
ABOUT
LUCY
AND
ABOUT
JONATHAN
IHAD
NOT
HEARD
FROM
JONATHAN
FOR
SOME
TIME
AND
WAS
VERY
CONCERNED
BUTYESTERDAY
DEAR
MR

WHO
IS
ALWAYS
SO
KIND
SENT
ME
A
LETTER
FROMHIM
I
HAD
WRITTEN
ASKING

HE
SAID
THE
ENCLOSEDHAD

ONLY
A
LINE
DATED
FROM
CASTLE
DRACULA
AND
SAYS
THAT
HE
IS
JUST
STARTING
FOR

THAT
IS
NOT
LIKE
JONATHAN
I
DO
NOT
UNDERSTAND
IT
AND
IT
MAKES
ME
UNEASY
THEN
TOO
LUCY
ALTHOUGH
SHE
IS
SO
WELL
HAS
LATELY
TAKEN
TO
HER
OLD
HABIT
OF
WALKING
INHER
SLEEP
HER
MOTHER
HAS
SPOKEN
TO
ME
ABOUT
IT
AND
WE
HAVE
DECIDEDTHAT
I
AM
TO
LOCK
THE
DOOR
OF
OUR
ROOM
EVERY

AN
IDEA
THAT

WALKERS
ALWAYS
GO
OUT
ON
ROOFS
OF
HOUSES
ANDALONG
THE
EDGES
OF
CLIFFS
AND
THEN
GET
SUDDENLY
WAKENED
AND
FALL
OVERWITH
A
DESPAIRING
CRY
THAT
ECHOES
ALL
OVER
THE
PLACE
POOR
DEAR
SHE
ISNATURALLY
ANXIOUS
ABOUT
LUCY
AND
SHE
TELLS
ME
THAT
HER
HUSBAND
LUCY
SFATHER
HAD
THE
SAME
HABIT
THAT
HE
WOULD
GET
UP
IN
THE
NIGHT
AND
DRESSHIMSELF
AND
GO

WERE
NOT
STOPPED

RIGHT
WHEN

I
AM
GETTING
QUITE
UNEASY
ABOUT
HIM
THOUGH
WHY
I
SHOULD
I
DO
NOT

I
DO
WISH
THAT
HE
WOULD
WRITE
IFIT
WERE
ONLY
A
SINGLE
LINE
LUCY
WALKS
MORE
THAN
EVER
AND
EACH
NIGHT
IAM
AWAKENED
BY
HER
MOVING
ABOUT
THE
ROOM
FORTUNATELY
THE
WEATHER
IS
SOHOT
THAT
SHE
CANNOT
GET
COLD
BUT
STILL
THE
ANXIETY
AND
THE
PERPETUALLYBEING
WAKENED
IS
BEGINNING
TO
TELL
ON
ME
AND
I
AM
GETTING
NERVOUS
ANDWAKEFUL
MYSELF
THANK

AND
LOOKING
OUT
I
CREPT
BEHINDIT
AND
GAVE

BUT
THE

AND
AS
HE

HE
TOOK
HIS

AND
DROVE
IT

INTOSPACE
THEN

IS
HERE
AND
I

PERHAPS
IN

AND
I

AS

LOUDLY
AMONG

SHUDDER
WHEN
A
SHARP
PUFF
CAME

STRANGELY
ENOUGH
LUCY
DID
NOT

UPTWICE
AND
DRESSED

EARLY
IN

WENT
DOWN
TO
THE

TO
SEEIF
ANYTHING

HAPPENED
IN
THE

THERE
WERE
VERY
FEW
PEOPLE
ABOUT
AND
THOUGH
THE
SUN
WAS
BRIGHT
AND
THE
AIR
CLEAR
AND
FRESH
THE
BIG
GRIM
LOOKING
WAVES
THAT
SEEMED
DARK
THEMSELVES
BECAUSE
THE
FOAM
THATTOPPED
THEM
WAS
LIKE
SNOW
FORCED
THEMSELVES
IN
THROUGH
THE
NARROW
MOUTHOF
THE
HARBOUR
LIKE
A
BULLYING
MAN
GOING
THROUGH
A
CROWD
SOMEHOW
IFELT
GLAD
THAT
JONATHAN
WAS
NOT
ON
THE

LAST

BUT
ON

BUT
OH
IS
HE
ON

WHERE
IS

FROM

UP
TO

LUCY
CAME
WITH

AND
WE
WENT
EARLY
TO
OUR
OLD
SEAT
WHILSTTHE
CORTEGE
OF

WENT
UP
THE

TO
THE

AND
CAME
DOWNAGAIN
WE
HAD
A
LOVELY

AND
SAW
THE
PROCESSION
NEARLY
ALL
THE
WAY
THE
POOR

WAS
LAID
TO

QUITE
NEAR

SO
THAT
WE
STOOD
ONIT
WHEN

SAW
EVERYTHING
POOR
LUCY
SEEMED
MUCH
UPSET
SHE
WAS
RESTLESS
AND
UNEASY
ALL
THE

AND
I
CANNOT
BUT
THINK
THATHER
DREAMING
AT

IS
TELLING
ON
HER
SHE
IS
QUITE
ODD
IN
ONE
THING
SHE
WILL
NOT
ADMIT
TO
ME
THAT
THERE
IS
ANY
CAUSE
FOR
RESTLESSNESS
OR
IFTHERE
BE
SHE
DOES
NOT
UNDERSTAND
IT
HERSELF
THERE
IS
AN
ADDITIONALCAUSE
IN
THAT
POOR
OLD
MR
SWALES

FOUND
DEAD
THIS
MORNING
ON

HIS

BEING
BROKEN
HE
HAD
EVIDENTLY
AS
THE

SAID
FALLEN
BACK
IN
THE

IN
SOME
SORT
OF
FRIGHT
FOR
THERE
WAS
A
LOOK
OFFEAR
AND
HORROR
ON
HIS

THAT
THE
MEN
SAID
MADE

SHUDDER
POORDEAR
OLD
MAN
PERHAPS
HE
HAD
SEEN
DEATH
WITH
HIS

LUCY
IS
SOSWEET
AND
SENSITIVE
THAT
SHE
FEELS
INFLUENCES
MORE
ACUTELY
THAN
OTHERPEOPLE
DO
JUST
NOW
SHE
WAS
QUITE
UPSET
BY
A
LITTLE
THING
WHICH
I
DIDNOT
MUCH
HEED
THOUGH
I
AM
MYSELF
VERY
FOND
OF
ANIMALS
ONE
OF
THE
MENWHO
CAME
UP
HERE
OFTEN
TO
LOOK
FOR
THE
BOATS
WAS
FOLLOWED
BY
HIS
DOG
THE
DOG
IS
ALWAYS
WITH
HIM
THEY
ARE
BOTH
QUIET
PERSONS
AND
I
NEVER
SAWTHE
MAN
ANGRY
NOR
HEARD
THE
DOG
BARK
DURING
THE
SERVICE
THE
DOG
WOULDNOT
COME
TO
ITS
MASTER
WHO
WAS
ON
THE
SEAT
WITH
US
BUT
KEPT
A
FEWYARDS
OFF
BARKING
AND
HOWLING
ITS

SPOKE
TO
IT
GENTLY
AND
THENHARSHLY
AND
THEN
ANGRILY
BUT
IT
WOULD
NEITHER
COME
NOR
CEASE
TO
MAKE
ANOISE
IT
WAS
IN
A
SORT
OF
FURY
WITH
ITS
EYES
SAVAGE
AND
ALL
ITS
HAIRSBRISTLING
OUT
LIKE
A
CAT
S
TAIL
WHEN
PUSS
IS
ON
THE
WAR
PATH
FINALLYTHE
MAN
TOO
GOT
ANGRY
AND
JUMPED
DOWN
AND
KICKED
THE
DOG
AND
THENTOOK
IT
BY
THE
SCRUFF
OF
THE
NECK
AND
HALF
DRAGGED
AND
HALF
THREW
IT
ONTHE
TOMBSTONE
ON
WHICH
THE
SEAT
IS
FIXED
THE
MOMENT
IT
TOUCHED
THESTONE
THE
POOR
THING
BECAME
QUIET
AND
FELL
ALL
INTO
A
TREMBLE
IT
DIDNOT
TRY
TO
GET
AWAY
BUT
CROUCHED
DOWN
QUIVERING
AND
COWERING
AND
WASIN
SUCH
A
PITIABLE
STATE
OF
TERROR
THAT
I
TRIED
THOUGH
WITHOUT

IT
LUCY
WAS
FULL
OF

TOO
BUT
SHE
DID
NOT
ATTEMPT
TOTOUCH
THE

BUT
LOOKED
AT
IT
IN
AN
AGONISED
SORT
OF
WAY
I
GREATLYFEAR
THAT
SHE
IS
OF
TOO
SUPER
SENSITIVE
A
NATURE
TO
GO
THROUGH
THE
WORLDWITHOUT

SHE
WILL
BE

IF

I

WE

AFTER
A
WHILE
WAS
IN
GAY
SPIRITS
OWING
I
THINK
TO
SOMEDEAR
COWS
WHO
CAME
NOSING
TOWARDS
US
IN
A
FIELD
CLOSE
TO
THE
LIGHTHOUSE
AND
FRIGHTENED
THE

OUT

I
BELIEVE
WE
FORGOT
EVERYTHINGEXCEPT
OF

PERSONAL
FEAR
AND
IT
SEEMED
TO
WIPE
THE

CLEANAND
GIVE
US
A
FRESH

WE
HAD
A

SEVERE
TEA
AT

IN
A
SWEET
LITTLE
OLD
FASHIONED
INN
WITH
A
BOW

RIGHT
OVERTHE

I
BELIEVE
WE
SHOULD
HAVESHOCKED
THE
NEW

WITH

APPETITES
MEN
ARE
MORE
TOLERANT
BLESSTHEM
THEN
WE
WALKED

WITH
SOME
OR
RATHER
MANY
STOPPAGES
TO
REST
AND
WITH
OUR
HEARTS
FULL
OF
A
CONSTANT
DREAD
OF
WILD
BULLS
LUCY
WASREALLY
TIRED
AND
WE
INTENDED
TO
CREEP
OFF
TO
BED
AS
SOON
AS
WE
COULD
THE
YOUNG
CURATE
CAME
IN
HOWEVER
AND
MRS
WESTENRA
ASKED
HIM
TO
STAYFOR
SUPPER
LUCY
AND
I
HAD
BOTH
A
FIGHT
FOR
IT
WITH
THE
DUSTY
MILLER
IKNOW
IT
WAS
A
HARD
FIGHT
ON
MY
PART
AND
I
AM
QUITE
HEROIC
I
THINK
THATSOME
DAY
THE
BISHOPS
MUST
GET
TOGETHER
AND
SEE
ABOUT
BREEDING
UP
A
NEWCLASS
OF
CURATES
WHO
DON
T
TAKE
SUPPER
NO
MATTER
HOW
THEY
MAY
BEPRESSED
TO
AND
WHO
WILL
KNOW
WHEN

LUCY
IS
ASLEEP
ANDBREATHING
SOFTLY
SHE
HAS
MORE
COLOUR
IN
HER
CHEEKS
THAN
USUAL
ANDLOOKS
OH
SO
SWEET
IF
MR
HOLMWOOD
FELL
IN
LOVE
WITH
HER
SEEING
HERONLY
IN
THE
DRAWING
ROOM
I
WONDER
WHAT
HE
WOULD
SAY
IF
HE
SAW
HER
NOW
SOME
OF
THE
NEW
WOMEN
WRITERS
WILL
SOME
DAY
START
AN
IDEA
THAT
MEN
ANDWOMEN
SHOULD
BE
ALLOWED
TO
SEE
EACH
OTHER
ASLEEP
BEFORE
PROPOSING
ORACCEPTING
BUT
I
SUPPOSE
THE
NEW
WOMAN
WON
T
CONDESCEND
IN
FUTURE
TOACCEPT
SHE
WILL
DO
THE
PROPOSING
HERSELF
AND
A
NICE
JOB
SHE
WILL
MAKEOF
IT
TOO
THERE
S
SOME
CONSOLATION
IN
THAT
I
AM
SO
HAPPY
TO
NIGHT
BECAUSE
DEAR
LUCY
SEEMS
BETTER
I
REALLY
BELIEVE
SHE
HAS
TURNED
THECORNER
AND
THAT
WE
ARE
OVER
HER
TROUBLES
WITH
DREAMING
I
SHOULD
BEQUITE
HAPPY
IF
I
ONLY
KNEW
IF
JONATHAN
GOD
BLESS

KEEP
HIM

A

NO

SO
I
MAY
AS
WELL

I
AM
TOO
AGITATED
TO

WE
HAVE
HAD
SUCH
AN
ADVENTURE
SUCH
ANAGONISING
EXPERIENCE
I
FELL
ASLEEP
AS
SOON
AS
I
HAD
CLOSED
MY
DIARY
SUDDENLY
I
BECAME
BROAD
AWAKE
AND
SAT
UP
WITH
A
HORRIBLE
SENSE
OF
FEARUPON
ME
AND
OF
SOME
FEELING
OF
EMPTINESS
AROUND
ME
THE
ROOM
WAS
DARK
SO
I
COULD
NOT
SEE
LUCY
S
BED
I
STOLE
ACROSS
AND
FELT
FOR
HER
THE
BEDWAS
EMPTY
I
LIT
A
MATCH
AND
FOUND
THAT
SHE
WAS
NOT
IN
THE

THEDOOR
WAS
SHUT
BUT
NOT
LOCKED
AS
I
HAD
LEFT
IT
I
FEARED
TO
WAKE

WHO
HAS
BEEN
MORE
THAN
USUALLY
ILL
LATELY
SO
THREW
ON
SOMECLOTHES
AND
GOT
READY
TO
LOOK
FOR
HER
AS
I
WAS
LEAVING

ITSTRUCK
ME
THAT
THE

ROOMS
OF
THE
HOUSE
WITH
AN
EVER
GROWING
FEARCHILLING
MY
HEART
FINALLY
I
CAME
TO
THE
HALL
DOOR
AND
FOUND
IT
OPEN
ITWAS
NOT
WIDE
OPEN
BUT
THE
CATCH
OF
THE
LOCK
HAD
NOT
CAUGHT
THE
PEOPLEOF
THE
HOUSE
ARE
CAREFUL
TO
LOCK
THE
DOOR
EVERY
NIGHT
SO
I
FEARED
THATLUCY
MUST
HAVE
GONE
OUT
AS
SHE
WAS
THERE
WAS
NO
TIME
TO
THINK
OF
WHATMIGHT
HAPPEN
A
VAGUE
OVERMASTERING
FEAR
OBSCURED
ALL
DETAILS
I
TOOK
ABIG
HEAVY
SHAWL
AND
RAN
OUT
THE
CLOCK
WAS
STRIKING
ONE
AS
I
WAS
IN
THECRESCENT
AND
THERE
WAS
NOT
A
SOUL
IN
SIGHT
I
RAN
ALONG
THE
NORTHTERRACE
BUT
COULD
SEE
NO
SIGN
OF
THE
WHITE
FIGURE
WHICH
I
EXPECTED
ATTHE
EDGE
OF
THE
WEST
CLIFF
ABOVE
THE
PIER
I
LOOKED
ACROSS
THE
HARBOUR
TOTHE
EAST
CLIFF
IN
THE
HOPE
OR
FEAR
I
DON
T
KNOW
WHICH
OF
SEEING
LUCYIN
OUR
FAVOURITE
SEAT
THERE
WAS
A
BRIGHT
FULL
MOON
WITH
HEAVY
BLACK
DRIVING
CLOUDS
WHICH
THREW
THE
WHOLE
SCENE
INTO
A
FLEETING
DIORAMA
OFLIGHT
AND
SHADE
AS
THEY
SAILED
ACROSS
FOR
A
MOMENT
OR
TWO
I
COULD
SEENOTHING
AS
THE
SHADOW
OF
A
CLOUD
OBSCURED
ST
MARY
S
CHURCH
AND
ALLAROUND
IT
THEN
AS
THE
CLOUD
PASSED
I
COULD
SEE
THE
RUINS
OF
THE
ABBEYCOMING
INTO
VIEW
AND
AS
THE
EDGE
OF
A
NARROW
BAND
OF
LIGHT
AS
SHARP
ASA
SWORD
CUT
MOVED
ALONG
THE
CHURCH
AND
THE
CHURCHYARD
BECAME
GRADUALLYVISIBLE
WHATEVER
MY
EXPECTATION
WAS
IT
WAS
NOT
DISAPPOINTED
FORTHERE
ON
OUR
FAVOURITE
SEAT
THE
SILVER
LIGHT
OF
THE
MOON
STRUCK
AHALF
RECLINING
FIGURE
SNOWY
WHITE
THE
COMING
OF
THE
CLOUD
WAS
TOOQUICK
FOR
ME
TO
SEE
MUCH
FOR
SHADOW
SHUT
DOWN
ON
LIGHT
ALMOSTIMMEDIATELY
BUT
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME
AS
THOUGH
SOMETHING
DARK
STOOD
BEHINDTHE
SEAT
WHERE
THE
WHITE
FIGURE
SHONE
AND
BENT
OVER
IT
WHAT
IT
WAS
WHETHER
MAN
OR
BEAST
I
COULD
NOT
TELL
I
DID
NOT
WAIT
TO
CATCH
ANOTHERGLANCE
BUT
FLEW
DOWN
THE
STEEP
STEPS
TO
THE
PIER
AND
ALONG
BY
THEFISH
MARKET
TO
THE
BRIDGE
WHICH
WAS
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
REACH
THE
EASTCLIFF
THE
TOWN
SEEMED
AS
DEAD
FOR
NOT
A
SOUL
DID
I
SEE
I
REJOICEDTHAT
IT
WAS
SO
FOR
I
WANTED
NO
WITNESS
OF
POOR
LUCY
S
CONDITION
THETIME
AND
DISTANCE
SEEMED
ENDLESS
AND
MY
KNEES
TREMBLED
AND
MY
BREATHCAME
LABOURED
AS
I
TOILED
UP
THE
ENDLESS
STEPS
TO
THE
ABBEY
I
MUST
HAVEGONE
FAST
AND
YET
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME
AS
IF
MY
FEET
WERE
WEIGHTED
WITHLEAD
AND
AS
THOUGH
EVERY
JOINT
IN
MY
BODY
WERE
RUSTY
WHEN
I
GOT
ALMOSTTO
THE
TOP
I
COULD
SEE
THE
SEAT
AND
THE
WHITE
FIGURE
FOR
I
WAS
NOWCLOSE
ENOUGH
TO
DISTINGUISH
IT
EVEN
THROUGH
THE
SPELLS
OF
SHADOW
THEREWAS
UNDOUBTEDLY
SOMETHING
LONG
AND
BLACK
BENDING
OVER
THEHALF
RECLINING
WHITE
FIGURE
I
CALLED
IN
FRIGHT
LUCY
LUCY
ANDSOMETHING
RAISED
A
HEAD
AND
FROM
WHERE
I
WAS
I
COULD
SEE
A
WHITE
FACEAND
RED
GLEAMING
EYES
LUCY
DID
NOT
ANSWER
AND
I
RAN
ON
TO
THEENTRANCE
OF
THE
CHURCHYARD
AS
I
ENTERED
THE
CHURCH
WAS
BETWEEN
ME
ANDTHE
SEAT
AND
FOR
A
MINUTE
OR
SO
I
LOST
SIGHT
OF
HER
WHEN
I
CAME
INVIEW
AGAIN
THE
CLOUD
HAD
PASSED
AND
THE
MOONLIGHT
STRUCK
SO
BRILLIANTLYTHAT
I
COULD
SEE
LUCY
HALF
RECLINING
WITH
HER
HEAD
LYING
OVER
THE
BACKOF
THE
SEAT
SHE
WAS
QUITE
ALONE
AND
THERE
WAS
NOT
A
SIGN
OF
ANY
LIVINGTHING
ABOUT
WHEN
I
BENT
OVER
HER
I
COULD
SEE
THAT
SHE
WAS
STILL
ASLEEP
HER
LIPSWERE
PARTED
AND
SHE
WAS
BREATHING
NOT
SOFTLY
AS
USUAL
WITH
HER
BUT
INLONG
HEAVY
GASPS
AS
THOUGH
STRIVING
TO
GET
HER
LUNGS
FULL
AT
EVERYBREATH
AS
I
CAME
CLOSE
SHE
PUT
UP
HER
HAND
IN
HER
SLEEP
AND
PULLED
THECOLLAR
OF
HER
NIGHTDRESS
CLOSE
AROUND
HER
THROAT
WHILST
SHE
DID
SOTHERE
CAME
A
LITTLE
SHUDDER
THROUGH
HER
AS
THOUGH
SHE
FELT
THE
COLD
IFLUNG
THE
WARM
SHAWL
OVER
HER
AND
DREW
THE
EDGES
TIGHT
ROUND
HER
NECK
FOR
I
DREADED
LEST
SHE
SHOULD
GET
SOME
DEADLY
CHILL
FROM
THE
NIGHT
AIR
UNCLAD
AS
SHE
WAS
I
FEARED
TO
WAKE
HER
ALL
AT
ONCE
SO
IN
ORDER
TOHAVE
MY
HANDS
FREE
THAT
I
MIGHT
HELP
HER
I
FASTENED
THE
SHAWL
AT
HERTHROAT
WITH
A
BIG
SAFETY
PIN
BUT
I
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
CLUMSY
IN
MY
ANXIETYAND
PINCHED
OR
PRICKED
HER
WITH
IT
FOR
BY
AND
BY
WHEN
HER
BREATHINGBECAME
QUIETER
SHE
PUT
HER
HAND
TO
HER
THROAT
AGAIN
AND
MOANED
WHEN
IHAD
HER
CAREFULLY
WRAPPED
UP
I
PUT
MY
SHOES
ON
HER
FEET
AND
THEN
BEGANVERY
GENTLY
TO
WAKE
HER
AT
FIRST
SHE
DID
NOT
RESPOND
BUT
GRADUALLY
SHEBECAME
MORE
AND
MORE
UNEASY
IN
HER
SLEEP
MOANING
AND
SIGHINGOCCASIONALLY
AT
LAST
AS
TIME
WAS
PASSING
FAST
AND
FOR
MANY
OTHERREASONS
I
WISHED
TO
GET
HER
HOME
AT
ONCE
I
SHOOK
HER
MORE
FORCIBLY
TILL
FINALLY
SHE
OPENED
HER
EYES
AND
AWOKE
SHE
DID
NOT
SEEM
SURPRISEDTO
SEE
ME
AS
OF
COURSE
SHE
DID
NOT
REALISE
ALL
AT
ONCE
WHERE
SHE
WAS
LUCY
ALWAYS
WAKES
PRETTILY
AND
EVEN
AT
SUCH
A
TIME
WHEN
HER
BODY
MUSTHAVE
BEEN
CHILLED
WITH
COLD
AND
HER
MIND
SOMEWHAT
APPALLED
AT
WAKINGUNCLAD
IN
A
CHURCHYARD
AT
NIGHT
SHE
DID
NOT
LOSE
HER
GRACE
SHETREMBLED
A
LITTLE
AND
CLUNG
TO
ME
WHEN
I
TOLD
HER
TO
COME
AT
ONCE
WITHME
HOME
SHE
ROSE
WITHOUT
A
WORD
WITH
THE
OBEDIENCE
OF
A
CHILD
AS
WEPASSED
ALONG
THE
GRAVEL
HURT
MY
FEET
AND
LUCY
NOTICED
ME
WINCE
SHESTOPPED
AND
WANTED
TO
INSIST
UPON
MY
TAKING
MY
SHOES
BUT
I
WOULD
NOT
HOWEVER
WHEN
WE
GOT
TO
THE
PATHWAY
OUTSIDE
THE
CHURCHYARD
WHERE
THEREWAS
A
PUDDLE
OF
WATER
REMAINING
FROM
THE
STORM
I
DAUBED
MY
FEET
WITHMUD
USING
EACH
FOOT
IN
TURN
ON
THE
OTHER
SO
THAT
AS
WE
WENT
HOME
NOONE
IN
CASE
WE
SHOULD
MEET
ANY
ONE
SHOULD
NOTICE
MY
BARE
FEET
FORTUNE
FAVOURED
US
AND
WE
GOT
HOME
WITHOUT
MEETING
A
SOUL
ONCE
WE
SAWA
MAN
WHO
SEEMED
NOT
QUITE
SOBER
PASSING
ALONG
A
STREET
IN
FRONT
OFUS
BUT
WE
HID
IN
A
DOOR
TILL
HE
HAD
DISAPPEARED
UP
AN
OPENING
SUCH
ASTHERE
ARE
HERE
STEEP
LITTLE
CLOSES
OR
WYNDS
AS
THEY
CALL
THEM
INSCOTLAND
MY
HEART
BEAT
SO
LOUD
ALL
THE
TIME
THAT
SOMETIMES
I
THOUGHT
ISHOULD
FAINT
I
WAS
FILLED
WITH
ANXIETY
ABOUT
LUCY
NOT
ONLY
FOR
HERHEALTH
LEST
SHE
SHOULD
SUFFER
FROM
THE
EXPOSURE
BUT
FOR
HER
REPUTATIONIN
CASE
THE
STORY
SHOULD
GET
WIND
WHEN
WE
GOT
IN
AND
HAD
WASHED
OURFEET
AND
HAD
SAID
A
PRAYER
OF
THANKFULNESS
TOGETHER
I
TUCKED
HER
INTOBED
BEFORE
FALLING
ASLEEP
SHE
ASKED
EVEN
IMPLORED
ME
NOT
TO
SAY
AWORD
TO
ANY
ONE
EVEN
HER
MOTHER
ABOUT
HER
SLEEP
WALKING
ADVENTURE
IHESITATED
AT
FIRST
TO
PROMISE
BUT
ON
THINKING
OF
THE
STATE
OF
HERMOTHER
S
HEALTH
AND
HOW
THE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
SUCH
A
THING
WOULD
FRET
HER
AND
THINKING
TOO
OF
HOW
SUCH
A
STORY
MIGHT
BECOME
DISTORTED
NAY
INFALLIBLY
WOULD
IN
CASE
IT
SHOULD
LEAK
OUT
I
THOUGHT
IT
WISER
TO
DOSO
I
HOPE
I
DID
RIGHT
I
HAVE
LOCKED
THE
DOOR
AND
THE
KEY
IS
TIED
TOMY

SO
PERHAPS
I
SHALL
NOT

FEEL
HOW
ABSOLUTELY
HAPPY
IT

AND
THE
MOONLIGHTFLITTED
A
GREAT
BAT
COMING
AND
GOING
IN
GREAT
WHIRLING
CIRCLES
ONCE
ORTWICE
IT
CAME
QUITE
CLOSE
BUT
WAS
I
SUPPOSE
FRIGHTENED
AT
SEEING
ME
AND
FLITTED
AWAY
ACROSS
THE
HARBOUR
TOWARDS
THE
ABBEY
WHEN
I
CAME
BACKFROM
THE
WINDOW
LUCY
HAD
LAIN
DOWN
AGAIN
AND
WAS

NOT
STIR
AGAIN
ALL

READING
AND
WRITING
ALL
DAY
LUCY
SEEMSTO
HAVE
BECOME
AS
MUCH
IN
LOVE
WITH
THE
SPOT
AS
I
AM
AND
IT
IS
HARD
TOGET
HER
AWAY
FROM
IT
WHEN
IT
IS
TIME
TO
COME
HOME
FOR
LUNCH
OR
TEA
ORDINNER
THIS
AFTERNOON
SHE
MADE
A
FUNNY
REMARK
WE
WERE
COMING
HOME
FORDINNER
AND
HAD
COME
TO
THE
TOP
OF
THE
STEPS
UP
FROM
THE
WEST
PIER
ANDSTOPPED
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
VIEW
AS
WE
GENERALLY
DO
THE
SETTING
SUN
LOWDOWN
IN
THE
SKY
WAS
JUST
DROPPING
BEHIND
KETTLENESS
THE
RED
LIGHT
WASTHROWN
OVER
ON
THE
EAST
CLIFF
AND
THE
OLD
ABBEY
AND
SEEMED
TO
BATHEEVERYTHING
IN
A
BEAUTIFUL
ROSY
GLOW
WE
WERE
SILENT
FOR
A
WHILE
ANDSUDDENLY
LUCY
MURMURED
AS
IF
TO
HERSELF
HIS
RED
EYES
AGAIN
THEY
ARE
JUST
THE
SAME
IT
WAS
SUCH
AN
ODDEXPRESSION
COMING
APROPOS
OF
NOTHING
THAT
IT
QUITE
STARTLED
ME
ISLEWED
ROUND
A
LITTLE
SO
AS
TO
SEE
LUCY
WELL
WITHOUT
SEEMING
TO
STAREAT
HER
AND
SAW
THAT
SHE
WAS
IN
A
HALF
DREAMY
STATE
WITH
AN
ODD
LOOK
ONHER
FACE
THAT
I
COULD
NOT
QUITE
MAKE
OUT
SO
I
SAID
NOTHING
BUTFOLLOWED
HER
EYES
SHE
APPEARED
TO
BE
LOOKING
OVER
AT
OUR
OWN
SEAT
WHEREON
WAS
A
DARK
FIGURE
SEATED
ALONE
I
WAS
A
LITTLE
STARTLED
MYSELF
FOR
IT
SEEMED
FOR
AN
INSTANT
AS
IF
THE
STRANGER
HAD
GREAT
EYES
LIKEBURNING
FLAMES
BUT
A
SECOND
LOOK
DISPELLED
THE
ILLUSION
THE
REDSUNLIGHT
WAS
SHINING
ON
THE
WINDOWS
OF
ST
MARY
S
CHURCH
BEHIND
OURSEAT
AND
AS
THE
SUN
DIPPED
THERE
WAS
JUST
SUFFICIENT
CHANGE
IN
THEREFRACTION
AND
REFLECTION
TO
MAKE
IT
APPEAR
AS
IF
THE
LIGHT
MOVED
ICALLED
LUCY
S
ATTENTION
TO
THE
PECULIAR
EFFECT
AND
SHE
BECAME
HERSELFWITH
A
START
BUT
SHE
LOOKED
SAD
ALL
THE
SAME
IT
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
THAT
SHEWAS
THINKING
OF
THAT
TERRIBLE
NIGHT
UP
THERE
WE
NEVER
REFER
TO
IT
SO
ISAID
NOTHING
AND
WE
WENT
HOME
TO
DINNER
LUCY
HAD
A
HEADACHE
AND
WENTEARLY
TO
BED
I
SAW
HER
ASLEEP
AND
WENT
OUT
FOR
A
LITTLE
STROLL
MYSELF
I
WALKED
ALONG
THE
CLIFFS
TO
THE
WESTWARD
AND
WAS
FULL
OF
SWEETSADNESS
FOR
I
WAS
THINKING
OF
JONATHAN
WHEN
COMING
HOME
IT
WAS
THENBRIGHT
MOONLIGHT
SO
BRIGHT
THAT
THOUGH
THE
FRONT
OF
OUR
PART
OF
THECRESCENT
WAS
IN
SHADOW
EVERYTHING
COULD
BE
WELL
SEEN
I
THREW
A
GLANCEUP
AT
OUR
WINDOW
AND
SAW
LUCY
S
HEAD
LEANING
OUT
I
THOUGHT
THATPERHAPS
SHE
WAS
LOOKING
OUT
FOR
ME
SO
I
OPENED
MY
HANDKERCHIEF
ANDWAVED
IT
SHE
DID
NOT
NOTICE
OR
MAKE
ANY
MOVEMENT
WHATEVER
JUST
THEN
THE
MOONLIGHT
CREPT
ROUND
AN
ANGLE
OF
THE
BUILDING
AND
THE
LIGHT
FELLON
THE
WINDOW
THERE
DISTINCTLY
WAS
LUCY
WITH
HER
HEAD
LYING
UP
AGAINSTTHE
SIDE
OF
THE
WINDOW
SILL
AND
HER
EYES
SHUT
SHE
WAS
FAST
ASLEEP
ANDBY
HER
SEATED
ON
THE
WINDOW
SILL
WAS
SOMETHING
THAT
LOOKED
LIKE
AGOOD
SIZED
BIRD
I
WAS
AFRAID
SHE
MIGHT
GET
A
CHILL
SO
I
RAN
UPSTAIRS
BUT
AS
I
CAME
INTO
THE
ROOM
SHE
WAS
MOVING
BACK
TO
HER
BED
FASTASLEEP
AND
BREATHING
HEAVILY
SHE
WAS
HOLDING
HER
HAND
TO
HER
THROAT
AS
THOUGH
TO
PROTECT
IT
FROM
COLD
I
DID
NOT
WAKE
HER
BUT
TUCKED
HER
UP
WARMLY
I
HAVE
TAKEN
CARE
THAT
THEDOOR
IS
LOCKED
AND
THE
WINDOW
SECURELY
FASTENED
SHE
LOOKS
SO
SWEET
AS
SHE
SLEEPS
BUT
SHE
IS
PALER
THAN
IS
HER
WONT
ANDTHERE
IS
A
DRAWN
HAGGARD
LOOK
UNDER
HER
EYES
WHICH
I
DO
NOT
LIKE
IFEAR
SHE
IS
FRETTING
ABOUT
SOMETHING
I
WISH
I
COULD
FIND
OUT

AND
THAT
IT

SHE
TAPPED
PLAYFULLY
WITHTHE
HEEL
OF
HER
BOOT
ON
THE
STONE
SLAB
AND
SAID
MY
POOR
LITTLE
FEET
DIDN

THEN
I
DARESAY
POOR
OLD
MR

WOULD
HAVE
TOLD
ME
THAT
IT
WAS
BECAUSE
I
DIDN
T
WANT
TO
WAKE
UPGEORDIE
AS
SHE
WAS
IN
SUCH
A
COMMUNICATIVE
HUMOUR
I
ASKED
HER
IF
SHEHAD
DREAMED
AT

THAT
NIGHT
BEFORE
SHE
ANSWERED
THAT
SWEET
PUCKEREDLOOK
CAME
INTO

FOREHEAD
WHICH
ARTHUR
I
CALL
HIM
ARTHUR
FROM

SAYS
HE
LOVES
AND
INDEED
I
DON
T
WONDER
THAT
HE
DOES
THEN
SHEWENT
ON
IN
A
HALF
DREAMING
KIND
OF
WAY
AS
IF
TRYING
TO
RECALL
IT
TOHERSELF
I
DIDN
T
QUITE
DREAM
BUT
IT
ALL
SEEMED
TO
BE
REAL
I
ONLY
WANTED
TO
BEHERE
IN
THIS
SPOT
I
DON
T
KNOW
WHY
FOR
I
WAS
AFRAID
OF
SOMETHING
IDON
T
KNOW
WHAT
I
REMEMBER
THOUGH
I
SUPPOSE
I
WAS
ASLEEP
PASSINGTHROUGH
THE
STREETS
AND
OVER
THE
BRIDGE
A
FISH
LEAPED
AS
I
WENT
BY
ANDI
LEANED
OVER
TO
LOOK
AT
IT
AND
I
HEARD
A
LOT
OF
DOGS
HOWLING
THEWHOLE
TOWN
SEEMED
AS
IF
IT
MUST
BE
FULL
OF
DOGS
ALL
HOWLING
AT
ONCE
ASI
WENT
UP
THE
STEPS
THEN
I
HAD
A
VAGUE
MEMORY
OF
SOMETHING
LONG
ANDDARK
WITH
RED
EYES
JUST
AS
WE
SAW
IN
THE
SUNSET
AND
SOMETHING
VERYSWEET
AND
VERY
BITTER
ALL
AROUND
ME
AT
ONCE
AND
THEN
I
SEEMED
SINKINGINTO
DEEP
GREEN
WATER
AND
THERE
WAS
A
SINGING
IN
MY
EARS
AS
I
HAVEHEARD
THERE
IS
TO
DROWNING
MEN
AND
THEN
EVERYTHING
SEEMED
PASSING
AWAYFROM
ME
MY
SOUL
SEEMED
TO
GO
OUT
FROM
MY
BODY
AND
FLOAT
ABOUT
THE
AIR
I
SEEM
TO
REMEMBER
THAT
ONCE
THE
WEST
LIGHTHOUSE
WAS
RIGHT
UNDER
ME
AND
THEN
THERE
WAS
A
SORT
OF
AGONISING
FEELING
AS
IF
I
WERE
IN
ANEARTHQUAKE
AND
I
CAME
BACK
AND
FOUND
YOU
SHAKING
MY
BODY
I
SAW
YOU
DOIT
BEFORE
I
FELT
YOU
THEN
SHE
BEGAN
TO
LAUGH
IT
SEEMED
A
LITTLE
UNCANNY
TO
ME
AND
ILISTENED
TO
HER
BREATHLESSLY
I
DID
NOT
QUITE
LIKE
IT
AND
THOUGHT
ITBETTER
NOT
TO
KEEP
HER
MIND
ON
THE
SUBJECT
SO
WE
DRIFTED
ON
TO
OTHERSUBJECTS
AND
LUCY
WAS
LIKE
HER
OLD
SELF
AGAIN
WHEN
WE
GOT

THEFRESH
BREEZE

BRACED

IF
SO
WE
MUST
LOOK
OUT
FOR

IN

ANDGREATER
DEGREE
I
DID
NOT

BUT
I
KEPT
STRICTOBSERVATION
ALL
THE
SAME
ALL
AT
ONCE
THAT
SHIFTY
LOOK
CAME
INTO
HISEYES
WHICH
WE
ALWAYS
SEE
WHEN
A
MADMAN
HAS
SEIZED
AN
IDEA
AND
WITH
ITTHE
SHIFTY
MOVEMENT
OF
THE
HEAD
AND
BACK
WHICH
ASYLUM
ATTENDANTS
COME
TOKNOW
SO
WELL
HE
BECAME
QUITE
QUIET
AND
WENT
AND
SAT
ON
THE
EDGE
OF
HISBED
RESIGNEDLY
AND
LOOKED
INTO
SPACE
WITH
LACK
LUSTRE
EYES
I
THOUGHT
IWOULD
FIND
OUT
IF
HIS
APATHY
WERE
REAL
OR
ONLY
ASSUMED
AND
TRIED
TOLEAD
HIM
TO
TALK
OF
HIS
PETS
A
THEME
WHICH
HAD
NEVER
FAILED
TO
EXCITEHIS
ATTENTION
AT
FIRST
HE
MADE
NO
REPLY
BUT
AT
LENGTH
SAID
TESTILY
BOTHER
THEM
ALL
I
DON
T
CARE
A
PIN
ABOUT
THEM
WHAT
I
SAID
YOU
DON
T
MEAN
TO
TELL
ME
YOU
DON
T
CARE
ABOUTSPIDERS
SPIDERS
AT
PRESENT
ARE
HIS
HOBBY
AND
THE
NOTE
BOOK
IS
FILLINGUP
WITH
COLUMNS
OF
SMALL
FIGURES
TO
THIS
HE
ANSWERED
ENIGMATICALLY
THE
BRIDE
MAIDENS
REJOICE
THE
EYES
THAT
WAIT
THE
COMING
OF
THE
BRIDE
BUT
WHEN
THE
BRIDE
DRAWETH
NIGH
THEN
THE
MAIDENS
SHINE
NOT
TO
THE
EYESTHAT
ARE
FILLED
HE
WOULD
NOT
EXPLAIN
HIMSELF
BUT
REMAINED
OBSTINATELY
SEATED
ON
HIS
BEDALL
THE
TIME
I
REMAINED
WITH
HIM
I
AM
WEARY
TO
NIGHT
AND
LOW
IN
SPIRITS
I
CANNOT
BUT
THINK
OF
LUCY
ANDHOW
DIFFERENT
THINGS
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
IF
I
DON
T
SLEEP
AT
ONCE
CHLORAL
THE
MODERN
MORPHEUS
C
HCL
O
H
O
I
MUST
BE
CAREFUL
NOT
TO
LETIT
GROW
INTO
A
HABIT
NO
I
SHALL
TAKE
NONE
TO
NIGHT
I
HAVE
THOUGHT
OFLUCY
AND
I
SHALL
NOT
DISHONOUR
HER
BY
MIXING
THE
TWO
IF
NEED
BE
TO
NIGHT
SHALL
BE
SLEEPLESS
LATER
GLAD
I
MADE
THE
RESOLUTION
GLADDER
THAT
I
KEPT
TO
IT
I
HADLAIN
TOSSING
ABOUT
AND
HAD
HEARD
THE
CLOCK
STRIKE
ONLY
TWICE
WHEN
THENIGHT
WATCHMAN
CAME
TO
ME
SENT
UP
FROM
THE
WARD
TO
SAY
THAT
RENFIELDHAD
ESCAPED
I
THREW
ON
MY
CLOTHES
AND
RAN
DOWN
AT
ONCE
MY
PATIENT
ISTOO
DANGEROUS
A
PERSON
TO
BE
ROAMING
ABOUT
THOSE
IDEAS
OF
HIS
MIGHTWORK
OUT
DANGEROUSLY
WITH
STRANGERS
THE
ATTENDANT
WAS
WAITING
FOR
ME
HE
SAID
HE
HAD
SEEN
HIM
NOT
TEN
MINUTES
BEFORE
SEEMINGLY
ASLEEP
IN
HISBED
WHEN
HE
HAD
LOOKED
THROUGH
THE
OBSERVATION
TRAP
IN
THE
DOOR
HISATTENTION
WAS
CALLED
BY
THE
SOUND
OF
THE
WINDOW
BEING
WRENCHED
OUT
HERAN
BACK
AND
SAW
HIS
FEET
DISAPPEAR
THROUGH
THE
WINDOW
AND
HAD
AT
ONCESENT
UP
FOR
ME
HE
WAS
ONLY
IN
HIS
NIGHT
GEAR
AND
CANNOT
BE
FAR
OFF
THE
ATTENDANT
THOUGHT
IT
WOULD
BE
MORE
USEFUL
TO
WATCH
WHERE
HE
SHOULDGO
THAN
TO
FOLLOW
HIM
AS
HE
MIGHT
LOSE
SIGHT
OF
HIM
WHILST
GETTING
OUTOF
THE
BUILDING
BY
THE
DOOR
HE
IS
A
BULKY
MAN
AND
COULDN

WITH

GONE
TO
THE

HAD
TAKEN
ASTRAIGHT
LINE
SO
I
RAN
AS
QUICKLY
AS
I
COULD
AS
I
GOT
THROUGH
THE
BELTOF
TREES
I
SAW
A
WHITE
FIGURE
SCALE
THE
HIGH
WALL
WHICH
SEPARATES
OURGROUNDS
FROM
THOSE
OF
THE
DESERTED
HOUSE
I
RAN
BACK
AT

TOLD
THE

GET
THREE
OR
FOUR

AND
FOLLOW

INTO
THE
GROUNDS
OF

DROPPED
DOWN
ON
THE
OTHER

I
COULD
SEE
RENFIELD

FIGURE
JUSTDISAPPEARING
BEHIND

SO
I
RAN
AFTER

ON
THEFAR

I
FOUND
HIM
PRESSED
CLOSE
AGAINST
THE
OLDIRONBOUND
OAK
DOOR
OF
THE
CHAPEL
HE
WAS
TALKING
APPARENTLY
TO
SOMEONE
BUT
I
WAS
AFRAID
TO
GO
NEAR
ENOUGH
TO
HEAR
WHAT
HE
WAS
SAYING
LESTI
MIGHT
FRIGHTEN
HIM
AND
HE
SHOULD
RUN
OFF
CHASING
AN
ERRANT
SWARM
OFBEES
IS
NOTHING
TO
FOLLOWING
A
NAKED
LUNATIC
WHEN
THE
FIT
OF
ESCAPINGIS
UPON
HIM
AFTER
A
FEW
MINUTES
HOWEVER
I
COULD
SEE
THAT
HE
DID
NOTTAKE
NOTE
OF
ANYTHING
AROUND
HIM
AND
SO
VENTURED
TO
DRAW
NEARER
TOHIM
THE
MORE
SO
AS
MY

CROSSED
THE

AND
WERE

COMBINATION
WHEN

THAT
AS

ATLEAST
HE
WANTS
ME
TO
BELIEVE

AND
I

HE

I
FEAR
IT

WHO

OF

THESECRETS
OF

IN
THE

THE

HAD
SOMETHING
OF
THEIR

SAY
CRINGING
SOFTNESS

SATISFIED
WITH
HIS
PRESENTCONDITION
AND
DIRECTED
HIM
TO
BE
RELIEVED
THE
ATTENDANTS
HESITATED
BUT
FINALLY
CARRIED
OUT
MY
WISHES
WITHOUT

IT
WAS
A
STRANGETHING
THAT
THE

HAD
HUMOUR
ENOUGH
TO
SEE
THEIR
DISTRUST
FOR
COMING
CLOSE
TO
ME
HE
SAID
IN
A
WHISPER
ALL
THE
WHILE
LOOKINGFURTIVELY
AT
THEM
THEY
THINK
I
COULD
HURT
YOU
FANCY
ME
HURTING
YOU
THE

SOOTHING
SOMEHOW
TO
THE
FEELINGS
TO
FIND
MYSELF
DISSOCIATEDEVEN
IN
THE
MIND
OF
THIS
POOR
MADMAN
FROM
THE
OTHERS
BUT
ALL
THE
SAME
IDO
NOT
FOLLOW
HIS
THOUGHT
AM
I
TO
TAKE
IT
THAT
I
HAVE
ANYTHING
INCOMMON
WITH
HIM
SO
THAT
WE
ARE
AS
IT
WERE
TO
STAND
TOGETHER
OR
HASHE
TO
GAIN
FROM

SO
STUPENDOUS
THAT
MY

IS
NEEDFULTO
HIM
I
MUST
FIND

I
AM

WOEFULLY
DIFFERENT
FROM
WHAT
SHE

SAWHER
LAST

YOU

IN

THAT
I
DID

AS
I
SHOULD

A
LITTLE
DIFFICULTY
WHICH
NOT
EVEN

I
HAD

TELL

EXACTLY
WHAT
HAPPENED
LEAVING
YOU
TODRAW
IN
A
MEASURE
YOUR
OWN
CONCLUSIONS
I
SHALL
THEN
SAY
WHAT
I
HAVEDONE
AND
PROPOSE
DOING
I
FOUND
MISS
WESTENRA
IN
SEEMINGLY
GAY
SPIRITS
HER
MOTHER
WAS
PRESENT
AND
IN
A
FEW
SECONDS
I
MADE
UP
MY
MIND
THAT
SHE
WAS
TRYING
ALL
SHE
KNEWTO
MISLEAD
HER
MOTHER
AND
PREVENT
HER
FROM
BEING
ANXIOUS
I
HAVE
NODOUBT
SHE
GUESSES
IF
SHE
DOES
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
NEED
OF
CAUTION
THERE
IS
WE
LUNCHED
ALONE
AND
AS
WE
ALL
EXERTED
OURSELVES
TO
BE
CHEERFUL
WEGOT
AS
SOME
KIND
OF
REWARD
FOR
OUR
LABOURS
SOME
REAL
CHEERFULNESSAMONGST
US
THEN
MRS
WESTENRA
WENT
TO
LIE
DOWN
AND
LUCY
WAS
LEFT
WITHME
WE
WENT
INTO
HER
BOUDOIR
AND
TILL
WE
GOT
THERE
HER
GAIETY
REMAINED
FOR
THE
SERVANTS
WERE
COMING
AND
GOING
AS
SOON
AS
THE
DOOR
WAS
CLOSED
HOWEVER
THE
MASK
FELL
FROM
HER
FACE
AND
SHE
SANK
DOWN
INTO
A
CHAIRWITH
A
GREAT
SIGH
AND
HID
HER
EYES
WITH
HER
HAND
WHEN
I
SAW
THAT
HERHIGH
SPIRITS
HAD
FAILED
I
AT
ONCE
TOOK
ADVANTAGE
OF
HER
REACTION
TOMAKE
A
DIAGNOSIS
SHE
SAID
TO
ME
VERY
SWEETLY
I
CANNOT
TELL
YOU
HOW
I
LOATHE
TALKING
ABOUT
MYSELF
I
REMINDED
HERTHAT
A
DOCTOR
S
CONFIDENCE
WAS
SACRED
BUT
THAT
YOU
WERE
GRIEVOUSLYANXIOUS
ABOUT
HER
SHE
CAUGHT
ON
TO
MY
MEANING
AT
ONCE
AND
SETTLED
THATMATTER
IN
A
WORD
TELL
ARTHUR
EVERYTHING
YOU
CHOOSE
I
DO
NOT
CARE
FORMYSELF
BUT
ALL
FOR
HIM
SO
I
AM
QUITE
FREE
I
COULD
EASILY
SEE
THAT
SHE
IS
SOMEWHAT
BLOODLESS
BUT
I
COULD
NOT
SEETHE
USUAL
ANAEMIC
SIGNS
AND
BY
A
CHANCE
I
WAS
ACTUALLY
ABLE
TO
TEST
THEQUALITY
OF
HER
BLOOD
FOR
IN
OPENING
A
WINDOW
WHICH
WAS
STIFF
A
CORDGAVE
WAY
AND
SHE
CUT
HER
HAND
SLIGHTLY
WITH
BROKEN
GLASS
IT
WAS
ASLIGHT
MATTER
IN
ITSELF
BUT
IT
GAVE
ME
AN
EVIDENT
CHANCE
AND
I
SECUREDA
FEW
DROPS
OF
THE
BLOOD
AND
HAVE
ANALYSED
THEM
THE
QUALITATIVEANALYSIS
GIVES
A
QUITE
NORMAL
CONDITION
AND
SHOWS
I
SHOULD
INFER
INITSELF
A
VIGOROUS
STATE
OF
HEALTH
IN
OTHER
PHYSICAL
MATTERS
I
WAS
QUITESATISFIED
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
NEED
FOR
ANXIETY
BUT
AS
THERE
MUST
BE
ACAUSE
SOMEWHERE
I
HAVE
COME
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
IT
MUST
BE
SOMETHINGMENTAL
SHE
COMPLAINS
OF
DIFFICULTY
IN
BREATHING
SATISFACTORILY
ATTIMES
AND
OF
HEAVY
LETHARGIC
SLEEP
WITH
DREAMS
THAT
FRIGHTEN
HER
BUTREGARDING
WHICH
SHE
CAN
REMEMBER
NOTHING
SHE
SAYS
THAT
AS
A
CHILD
SHEUSED
TO
WALK
IN
HER
SLEEP
AND
THAT
WHEN
IN
WHITBY
THE
HABIT
CAME
BACK
AND
THAT
ONCE
SHE
WALKED
OUT
IN
THE
NIGHT
AND
WENT
TO
EAST
CLIFF
WHEREMISS
MURRAY
FOUND
HER
BUT
SHE
ASSURES
ME
THAT
OF
LATE
THE
HABIT
HAS
NOTRETURNED
I
AM
IN
DOUBT
AND
SO
HAVE
DONE
THE
BEST
THING
I
KNOW
OF
IHAVE
WRITTEN
TO

AS

ON
WHAT
GROUND
HE

WE
MUST
ACCEPT
HISWISHES
HE
IS
A
SEEMINGLY
ARBITRARY

SEPTEMBER
MY
DEAR
ART
VAN
HELSING
HAS
COME
AND
GONE
HE
CAME
ON
WITH
ME
TO
HILLINGHAM
ANDFOUND
THAT
BY
LUCY
S
DISCRETION
HER
MOTHER
WAS
LUNCHING
OUT
SO
THATWE
WERE
ALONE
WITH
HER
VAN
HELSING
MADE
A
VERY
CAREFUL
EXAMINATION
OFTHE
PATIENT
HE
IS
TO
REPORT
TO
ME
AND
I
SHALL
ADVISE
YOU
FOR
OFCOURSE
I
WAS
NOT
PRESENT
ALL
THE
TIME
HE
IS
I
FEAR
MUCH
CONCERNED
BUT
SAYS
HE
MUST
THINK
WHEN
I
TOLD
HIM
OF
OUR
FRIENDSHIP
AND
HOW
YOUTRUST
TO
ME
IN
THE
MATTER
HE
SAID
YOU
MUST
TELL
HIM
ALL
YOU
THINK
TELL
HIM
WHAT
I
THINK
IF
YOU
CAN
GUESS
IT
IF
YOU
WILL
NAY
I
AM
NOTJESTING
THIS
IS
NO
JEST
BUT
LIFE
AND
DEATH
PERHAPS
MORE
I
ASKEDWHAT
HE
MEANT
BY
THAT
FOR
HE
WAS
VERY
SERIOUS
THIS
WAS
WHEN
WE
HADCOME
BACK
TO
TOWN
AND
HE
WAS
HAVING
A
CUP
OF
TEA
BEFORE
STARTING
ON
HISRETURN
TO
AMSTERDAM
HE
WOULD
NOT
GIVE
ME
ANY
FURTHER
CLUE
YOU
MUST
NOTBE
ANGRY
WITH
ME
ART
BECAUSE
HIS
VERY
RETICENCE
MEANS
THAT
ALL
HISBRAINS
ARE
WORKING
FOR
HER
GOOD
HE
WILL
SPEAK
PLAINLY
ENOUGH
WHEN
THETIME
COMES
BE
SURE
SO
I
TOLD
HIM
I
WOULD
SIMPLY
WRITE
AN
ACCOUNT
OFOUR
VISIT
JUST
AS
IF
I
WERE
DOING
A
DESCRIPTIVE
SPECIAL
ARTICLE
FOR
THE
DAILY
TELEGRAPH
HE
SEEMED
NOT
TO
NOTICE
BUT
REMARKED
THAT
THESMUTS
IN
LONDON
WERE
NOT
QUITE
SO
BAD
AS
THEY
USED
TO
BE
WHEN
HE
WAS
ASTUDENT
HERE
I
AM
TO
GET
HIS
REPORT
TO
MORROW
IF
HE
CAN
POSSIBLY
MAKEIT
IN
ANY
CASE
I
AM
TO
HAVE
A
LETTER
WELL
AS
TO
THE
VISIT
LUCY
WAS
MORE
CHEERFUL
THAN
ON
THE
DAY
I
FIRSTSAW
HER
AND
CERTAINLY
LOOKED
BETTER
SHE
HAD
LOST
SOMETHING
OF
THEGHASTLY
LOOK
THAT
SO
UPSET
YOU
AND
HER
BREATHING
WAS
NORMAL
SHE
WASVERY
SWEET
TO
THE
PROFESSOR
AS
SHE
ALWAYS
IS
AND
TRIED
TO
MAKE
HIMFEEL
AT
EASE
THOUGH
I
COULD
SEE
THAT
THE
POOR
GIRL
WAS
MAKING
A
HARDSTRUGGLE
FOR
IT
I
BELIEVE
VAN
HELSING
SAW
IT
TOO
FOR
I
SAW
THE
QUICKLOOK
UNDER
HIS
BUSHY
BROWS
THAT
I
KNEW
OF
OLD
THEN
HE
BEGAN
TO
CHAT
OFALL
THINGS
EXCEPT
OURSELVES
AND
DISEASES
AND
WITH
SUCH
AN
INFINITEGENIALITY
THAT
I
COULD
SEE
POOR
LUCY
S
PRETENSE
OF
ANIMATION
MERGE
INTOREALITY
THEN
WITHOUT
ANY
SEEMING
CHANGE
HE
BROUGHT
THE
CONVERSATIONGENTLY
ROUND
TO
HIS
VISIT
AND
SUAVELY
SAID
MY
DEAR
YOUNG
MISS
I
HAVE
THE
SO
GREAT
PLEASURE
BECAUSE
YOU
ARE
SOMUCH
BELOVED
THAT
IS
MUCH
MY
DEAR
EVER
WERE
THERE
THAT
WHICH
I
DO
NOTSEE
THEY
TOLD
ME
YOU
WERE
DOWN
IN
THE
SPIRIT
AND
THAT
YOU
WERE
OF
AGHASTLY
PALE
TO
THEM
I
SAY
POUF
AND
HE
SNAPPED
HIS
FINGERS
AT
MEAND
WENT
ON
BUT
YOU
AND
I
SHALL
SHOW
THEM
HOW
WRONG
THEY
ARE
HOW
CANHE
AND
HE
POINTED
AT
ME
WITH
THE
SAME
LOOK
AND
GESTURE
AS
THAT
WITHWHICH
ONCE
HE
POINTED
ME
OUT
TO
HIS
CLASS
ON
OR
RATHER
AFTER
APARTICULAR
OCCASION
WHICH
HE
NEVER
FAILS
TO
REMIND
ME
OF
KNOW
ANYTHINGOF
A
YOUNG
LADIES
HE
HAS
HIS
MADAMS
TO
PLAY
WITH
AND
TO
BRING
THEMBACK
TO
HAPPINESS
AND
TO
THOSE
THAT
LOVE
THEM
IT
IS
MUCH
TO
DO
AND
OH
BUT
THERE
ARE
REWARDS
IN
THAT
WE
CAN
BESTOW
SUCH
HAPPINESS
BUT
THEYOUNG
LADIES
HE
HAS
NO
WIFE
NOR
DAUGHTER
AND
THE
YOUNG
DO
NOT
TELLTHEMSELVES
TO
THE
YOUNG
BUT
TO
THE
OLD
LIKE
ME
WHO
HAVE
KNOWN
SO
MANYSORROWS

FORTUNATELY
THE

SOVIOLENT
THAT

ALL
THEIR

HOWEVER
HE
BEGAN
TO
GET
MORE
AND

QUIET
AND

SANKINTO
A

OF
MELANCHOLY
IN
WHICH
STATE
HE

NOW
THEATTENDANT
TELLS
ME
THAT
HIS
SCREAMS
WHILST
IN

WERE
REALLYAPPALLING
I

EVEN
ME
THOUGH
I
WASSOME
DISTANCE
AWAY
IT
IS
NOW
AFTER

DINNER
HOUR
OF

ANDAS
YET
MY

SITS
IN
A
CORNER
BROODING
WITH
A
DULL
SULLEN
WOE
BEGONE
LOOK
IN
HIS

WHICH
SEEMS
RATHER
TO
INDICATE
THAN
TO
SHOWSOMETHING
DIRECTLY
I
CANNOT
QUITE
UNDERSTAND
IT
LATER
ANOTHER
CHANGE
IN
MY
PATIENT
AT
FIVE
O
CLOCK
I
LOOKED
IN
ONHIM
AND
FOUND
HIM
SEEMINGLY
AS
HAPPY
AND
CONTENTED
AS
HE
USED
TO
BE
HEWAS
CATCHING
FLIES
AND
EATING
THEM
AND
WAS
KEEPING
NOTE
OF
HIS
CAPTUREBY
MAKING
NAIL
MARKS
ON
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
DOOR
BETWEEN
THE
RIDGES
OFPADDING
WHEN
HE
SAW
ME
HE
CAME
OVER
AND
APOLOGISED
FOR
HIS
BADCONDUCT
AND
ASKED
ME
IN
A
VERY
HUMBLE
CRINGING
WAY
TO
BE
LED
BACK
TOHIS
OWN
ROOM
AND
TO
HAVE
HIS
NOTE
BOOK
AGAIN
I
THOUGHT
IT
WELL
TOHUMOUR
HIM
SO
HE
IS
BACK
IN
HIS
ROOM
WITH
THE
WINDOW
OPEN
HE
HAS
THESUGAR
OF
HIS
TEA
SPREAD
OUT
ON
THE
WINDOW
SILL
AND
IS
REAPING
QUITE
AHARVEST
OF
FLIES
HE
IS
NOT
NOW
EATING
THEM
BUT
PUTTING
THEM
INTO
ABOX
AS
OF
OLD
AND
IS
ALREADY
EXAMINING
THE
CORNERS
OF
HIS
ROOM
TO
FINDA
SPIDER
I
TRIED
TO
GET
HIM
TO
TALK
ABOUT
THE
PAST
FEW
DAYS
FOR
ANYCLUE
TO
HIS
THOUGHTS
WOULD
BE
OF
IMMENSE
HELP
TO
ME
BUT
HE
WOULD
NOTRISE
FOR
A
MOMENT
OR
TWO
HE
LOOKED
VERY
SAD
AND
SAID
IN
A
SORT
OFFAR
AWAY
VOICE
AS
THOUGH
SAYING
IT
RATHER
TO
HIMSELF
THAN
TO
ME
ALL
OVER
ALL
OVER
HE
HAS
DESERTED
ME
NO
HOPE
FOR
ME
NOW
UNLESS
I
DOIT
FOR
MYSELF
THEN
SUDDENLY
TURNING
TO
ME
IN
A
RESOLUTE
WAY
HE
SAID
DOCTOR
WON
T
YOU
BE
VERY
GOOD
TO
ME
AND
LET
ME
HAVE
A
LITTLE
MORESUGAR
I
THINK
IT
WOULD
BE
GOOD
FOR
ME
AND
THE
FLIES
I
SAID
YES
THE
FLIES
LIKE
IT
TOO
AND
I
LIKE
THE
FLIES
THEREFORE
I
LIKEIT
AND
THERE
ARE
PEOPLE
WHO
KNOW
SO
LITTLE
AS
TO
THINK
THAT
MADMEN
DONOT
ARGUE
I
PROCURED
HIM
A
DOUBLE
SUPPLY
AND
LEFT
HIM
AS
HAPPY
A
MANAS
I
SUPPOSE
ANY
IN
THE
WORLD
I
WISH
I
COULD
FATHOM
HIS
MIND
MIDNIGHT
ANOTHER
CHANGE
IN
HIM
I
HAD
BEEN
TO
SEE
MISS

WHOM
I
FOUND
MUCH
BETTER
AND
HAD
JUST
RETURNED

WAS
STANDING
AT
OUROWN

LOOKING
AT
THE
SUNSET
WHEN
ONCE
MORE
I
HEARD
HIM
YELLING
ASHIS
ROOM
IS
ON
THIS
SIDE
OF
THE
HOUSE
I
COULD
HEAR
IT
BETTER
THAN
INTHE

IT
WAS
A
SHOCK
TO
ME
TO
TURN
FROM
THE
WONDERFUL
SMOKYBEAUTY
OF
A
SUNSET
OVER
LONDON
WITH
ITS
LURID
LIGHTS
AND
INKY
SHADOWSAND
ALL
THE
MARVELLOUS
TINTS
THAT
COME
ON
FOUL
CLOUDS
EVEN
AS
ON
FOULWATER
AND
TO
REALISE
ALL
THE
GRIM
STERNNESS
OF
MY
OWN
COLD
STONEBUILDING
WITH
ITS
WEALTH
OF
BREATHING
MISERY
AND
MY
OWN
DESOLATE
HEARTTO
ENDURE
IT
ALL
I
REACHED
HIM
JUST
AS
THE
SUN
WAS
GOING
DOWN
AND
FROMHIS
WINDOW
SAW
THE
RED
DISC
SINK
AS
IT
SANK
HE
BECAME
LESS

LESSFRENZIED
AND
JUST
AS
IT
DIPPED
HE
SLID
FROM
THE
HANDS
THAT
HELD
HIM
ANINERT
MASS
ON
THE

IT
IS
WONDERFUL
HOWEVER
WHAT
INTELLECTUALRECUPERATIVE
POWER
LUNATICS
HAVE
FOR
WITHIN
A
FEW
MINUTES
HE
STOOD
UPQUITE
CALMLY
AND
LOOKED
AROUND
HIM
I
SIGNALLED
TO
THE
ATTENDANTS
NOT
TOHOLD
HIM
FOR
I
WAS
ANXIOUS
TO
SEE
WHAT
HE
WOULD
DO
HE
WENT
STRAIGHTOVER
TO
THE
WINDOW
AND
BRUSHED
OUT
THE
CRUMBS
OF
SUGAR
THEN
HE
TOOK
HISFLY
BOX
AND
EMPTIED

THREW
AWAY
THE

THEN
HE
SHUTTHE

AND
CROSSING

TOOK
WITH

ABAG
IN
WHICH
WERE
MANY
INSTRUMENTS

THE
GHASTLY
PARAPHERNALIAOF
OUR
BENEFICIAL
TRADE
AS

ONCE
CALLED
IN

WHEN

WERE
SHOWN
IN

WESTENRA
MET
US
SHE
WAS
ALARMED

NOT
NEARLY
SO
MUCH
AS
IEXPECTED
TO

ORDAINEDTHAT

HAS
SOME
ANTIDOTE
TO

HERE
IN

PROVE
FATAL

ARE
SO
ORDERED

OR
OTHER
THE
THINGS
NOT

EVEN
THE
TERRIBLE
CHANGE
IN
HERDAUGHTER
TO
WHOM
SHE
IS
SO
ATTACHED
DO
NOT

WHICH
CAN
PROTECT

I
THINK
DESERVE
ANOTHER
KISS
WHICH
HE

AND
AS
HE
HAD
NOW
FINISHED
HIS
OPERATION
HE
ADJUSTED
THEPILLOW
TO

BUCKLED
WITH

UP

THE
DEEP
HISS
OF
INDRAWN
BREATH
WHICH
IS
ONE
OF
VAN
HELSING
SWAYS
OF
BETRAYING
EMOTION
HE

HE
PROCEEDED
THEN
SWIFTLY
AND
DEFTLY
TO
CARRY
OUT
HISINTENT
THE
EFFECT
ON
LUCY
WAS
NOT
BAD
FOR
THE
FAINT
SEEMED
TO
MERGESUBTLY
INTO
THE
NARCOTIC
SLEEP
IT
WAS
WITH
A
FEELING
OF

STEAL
BACK
INTO

NO

INTO
THE

OF

THE

WATCHED
ME
CRITICALLY
THAT
WILL
DO
HE
SAID
ALREADY
I
REMONSTRATED
YOU
TOOK
A
GREAT
DEAL
MORE
FROM

TO
WHICH
HESMILED
A
SAD
SORT
OF
SMILE
AS
HE
REPLIED
HE
IS
HER
LOVER
HER
FIANCE
YOU
HAVE
WORK
MUCH
WORK
TO
DO
FOR
HERAND
FOR
OTHERS
AND
THE
PRESENT
WILL
SUFFICE
WHEN
WE
STOPPED
THE
OPERATION
HE
ATTENDED
TO
LUCY
WHILST
I
APPLIEDDIGITAL
PRESSURE
TO
MY
OWN
INCISION
I
LAID
DOWN
WHILST
I
WAITED
HISLEISURE
TO
ATTEND
TO
ME
FOR
I
FELT
FAINT
AND
A
LITTLE
SICK
BY
AND
BYHE
BOUND
UP
MY
WOUND
AND
SENT
ME
DOWNSTAIRS
TO
GET
A
GLASS
OF
WINE
FORMYSELF
AS
I
WAS
LEAVING
THE
ROOM
HE
CAME
AFTER
ME
AND
HALFWHISPERED
MIND
NOTHING
MUST
BE
SAID
OF
THIS
IF
OUR
YOUNG
LOVER
SHOULD
TURN
UPUNEXPECTED
AS
BEFORE
NO
WORD
TO
HIM
IT
WOULD
AT
ONCE
FRIGHTEN
HIM
ANDENJEALOUS
HIM
TOO
THERE
MUST
BE
NONE
SO
WHEN
I
CAME
BACK
HE
LOOKED
AT
ME
CAREFULLY
AND
THEN
SAID
YOU
ARE
NOT
MUCH
THE
WORSE
GO
INTO
THE
ROOM
AND
LIE
ON
YOUR
SOFA
ANDREST
AWHILE
THEN
HAVE
MUCH
BREAKFAST
AND
COME
HERE
TO
ME
I
FOLLOWED
OUT
HIS
ORDERS
FOR
I
KNEW
HOW
RIGHT
AND
WISE
THEY
WERE
IHAD
DONE
MY
PART
AND
NOW
MY
NEXT
DUTY
WAS
TO
KEEP
UP
MY
STRENGTH
IFELT
VERY
WEAK
AND
IN
THE
WEAKNESS
LOST
SOMETHING
OF
THE
AMAZEMENT
ATWHAT
HAD
OCCURRED
I
FELL
ASLEEP
ON
THE
SOFA
HOWEVER
WONDERING
OVERAND
OVER
AGAIN
HOW
LUCY
HAD
MADE
SUCH
A
RETROGRADE
MOVEMENT
AND
HOWSHE
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
DRAINED
OF
SO
MUCH
BLOOD
WITH
NO
SIGN
ANYWHERE
TOSHOW
FOR
IT
I
THINK
I
MUST
HAVE
CONTINUED
MY
WONDER
IN
MY
DREAMS
FOR
SLEEPING
AND
WAKING
MY
THOUGHTS
ALWAYS
CAME
BACK
TO
THE
LITTLEPUNCTURES
IN
HER
THROAT
AND
THE
RAGGED
EXHAUSTED
APPEARANCE
OF
THEIREDGES
TINY
THOUGH
THEY
WERE

SLEPT
WELL
INTO
THE
DAY
AND
WHEN

WAS
FAIRLY

LUCY
CHATTED
WITH

FREELY

THEN

I
ACCOUNTS
FOR
IT
THIS

WE
WENT
ALONG
AND
IN
THE
DINING
ROOM
DIMLY
LIT
BY
RAYS
OF
LIGHT
THROUGH
THE
SHUTTERS
FOUND
FOURSERVANT
WOMEN
LYING
ON
THE
FLOOR
THERE
WAS
NO
NEED
TO
THINK
THEM
DEAD
FOR
THEIR
STERTOROUS
BREATHING
AND
THE
ACRID
SMELL
OF
LAUDANUM
IN
THEROOM
LEFT
NO
DOUBT
AS
TO
THEIR
CONDITION
VAN
HELSING
AND
I
LOOKED
ATEACH
OTHER
AND
AS
WE
MOVED
AWAY
HE
SAID
WE
CAN
ATTEND
TO
THEM
LATER
THEN
WE
ASCENDED
TO
LUCY
S
ROOM
FOR
AN
INSTANT
OR
TWO
WE
PAUSED
AT
THEDOOR
TO
LISTEN
BUT
THERE
WAS
NO
SOUND
THAT
WE
COULD
HEAR
WITH
WHITEFACES
AND
TREMBLING
HANDS
WE
OPENED
THE
DOOR
GENTLY
AND
ENTERED
THEROOM
HOW
SHALL
I
DESCRIBE
WHAT
WE
SAW
ON
THE
BED
LAY
TWO
WOMEN
LUCY
AND
HERMOTHER
THE
LATTER
LAY
FARTHEST
IN
AND
SHE
WAS
COVERED
WITH
A
WHITESHEET
THE
EDGE
OF
WHICH
HAD
BEEN
BLOWN
BACK
BY
THE
DRAUGHT
THROUGH
THEBROKEN
WINDOW
SHOWING
THE
DRAWN
WHITE
FACE
WITH
A
LOOK
OF
TERRORFIXED
UPON
IT
BY
HER
SIDE
LAY
LUCY
WITH
FACE
WHITE
AND
STILL
MOREDRAWN
THE
FLOWERS
WHICH
HAD
BEEN
ROUND
HER
NECK
WE
FOUND
UPON
HERMOTHER
S
BOSOM
AND
HER
THROAT
WAS
BARE
SHOWING
THE
TWO
LITTLE
WOUNDSWHICH
WE
HAD
NOTICED
BEFORE
BUT
LOOKING
HORRIBLY
WHITE
AND
MANGLED
WITHOUT
A
WORD
THE
PROFESSOR
BENT
OVER
THE
BED
HIS
HEAD
ALMOST
TOUCHINGPOOR
LUCY
S
BREAST
THEN
HE
GAVE
A
QUICK
TURN
OF
HIS
HEAD
AS
OF
ONE
WHOLISTENS
AND
LEAPING
TO
HIS
FEET
HE
CRIED
OUT
TO
ME
IT
IS
NOT
YET
TOO
LATE
QUICK
QUICK
BRING
THE
BRANDY
I
FLEW
DOWNSTAIRS
AND
RETURNED
WITH
IT
TAKING
CARE
TO
SMELL
AND
TASTEIT
LEST
IT
TOO
WERE
DRUGGED
LIKE
THE
DECANTER
OF
SHERRY
WHICH
I
FOUNDON
THE
TABLE
THE
MAIDS
WERE
STILL
BREATHING
BUT
MORE
RESTLESSLY
AND
IFANCIED
THAT
THE
NARCOTIC
WAS
WEARING
OFF
I
DID
NOT
STAY
TO
MAKE
SURE
BUT
RETURNED
TO
VAN
HELSING
HE
RUBBED
THE
BRANDY
AS
ON
ANOTHEROCCASION
ON
HER
LIPS
AND
GUMS
AND
ON
HER
WRISTS
AND
THE
PALMS
OF
HERHANDS
HE
SAID
TO
ME
I
CAN
DO
THIS
ALL
THAT
CAN
BE
AT
THE
PRESENT
YOU
GO
WAKE
THOSE
MAIDS
FLICK
THEM
IN
THE
FACE
WITH
A
WET
TOWEL
AND
FLICK
THEM
HARD
MAKE
THEMGET
HEAT
AND
FIRE
AND
A
WARM
BATH
THIS
POOR
SOUL
IS
NEARLY
AS
COLD
ASTHAT
BESIDE
HER
SHE
WILL
NEED
BE
HEATED
BEFORE
WE
CAN
DO
ANYTHINGMORE
I
WENT
AT
ONCE
AND
FOUND
LITTLE
DIFFICULTY
IN
WAKING
THREE
OF
THEWOMEN
THE
FOURTH
WAS
ONLY
A
YOUNG
GIRL
AND
THE
DRUG
HAD
EVIDENTLYAFFECTED
HER
MORE
STRONGLY
SO
I
LIFTED
HER
ON
THE
SOFA
AND
LET
HERSLEEP
THE
OTHERS
WERE
DAZED
AT
FIRST
BUT
AS
REMEMBRANCE
CAME
BACK
TOTHEM
THEY
CRIED
AND
SOBBED
IN
A
HYSTERICAL
MANNER
I
WAS
STERN
WITHTHEM
HOWEVER
AND
WOULD
NOT
LET
THEM
TALK
I
TOLD
THEM
THAT
ONE
LIFEWAS
BAD
ENOUGH
TO
LOSE
AND
THAT
IF
THEY
DELAYED
THEY
WOULD
SACRIFICEMISS
LUCY
SO
SOBBING
AND
CRYING
THEY
WENT
ABOUT
THEIR
WAY
HALF
CLADAS
THEY
WERE
AND
PREPARED
FIRE
AND
WATER
FORTUNATELY
THE
KITCHEN
ANDBOILER
FIRES
WERE
STILL
ALIVE
AND
THERE
WAS
NO
LACK
OF
HOT
WATER
WEGOT
A
BATH
AND
CARRIED
LUCY
OUT
AS
SHE
WAS
AND
PLACED
HER
IN
IT
WHILSTWE
WERE
BUSY
CHAFING
HER
LIMBS
THERE
WAS
A
KNOCK
AT
THE
HALL
DOOR
ONEOF
THE
MAIDS
RAN
OFF
HURRIED
ON
SOME
MORE
CLOTHES
AND
OPENED
IT
THENSHE
RETURNED
AND
WHISPERED
TO
US
THAT
THERE
WAS
A
GENTLEMAN
WHO
HAD
COMEWITH
A
MESSAGE
FROM
MR
HOLMWOOD
I
BADE
HER
SIMPLY
TELL
HIM
THAT
HEMUST
WAIT
FOR
WE
COULD
SEE
NO
ONE
NOW
SHE
WENT
AWAY
WITH
THE
MESSAGE
AND
ENGROSSED
WITH
OUR
WORK
I
CLEAN
FORGOT
ALL
ABOUT
HIM
I
NEVER
SAW
IN
ALL
MY
EXPERIENCE
THE
PROFESSOR
WORK
IN
SUCH
DEADLYEARNEST
I
KNEW
AS
HE
KNEW
THAT
IT
WAS
A
STAND
UP
FIGHT
WITH
DEATH
AND
IN
A
PAUSE
TOLD
HIM
SO
HE
ANSWERED
ME
IN
A
WAY
THAT
I
DID
NOTUNDERSTAND
BUT
WITH
THE
STERNEST
LOOK
THAT
HIS
FACE
COULD
WEAR
IF
THAT
WERE
ALL
I
WOULD
STOP
HERE
WHERE
WE
ARE
NOW
AND
LET
HER
FADEAWAY
INTO
PEACE
FOR
I
SEE
NO
LIGHT
IN
LIFE
OVER
HER
HORIZON
HE
WENTON
WITH
HIS
WORK
WITH
IF
POSSIBLE
RENEWED
AND
MORE
FRENZIED
VIGOUR
PRESENTLY
WE
BOTH
BEGAN
TO
BE
CONSCIOUS
THAT
THE
HEAT
WAS
BEGINNING
TOBE
OF
SOME
EFFECT
LUCY
S
HEART
BEAT
A
TRIFLE
MORE
AUDIBLY
TO
THESTETHOSCOPE
AND
HER
LUNGS
HAD
A
PERCEPTIBLE
MOVEMENT
VAN
HELSING
SFACE
ALMOST
BEAMED
AND
AS
WE
LIFTED
HER
FROM
THE
BATH
AND
ROLLED
HER
INA
HOT
SHEET
TO
DRY
HER
HE
SAID
TO
ME
THE
FIRST
GAIN
IS
OURS
CHECK
TO
THE
KING
WE
TOOK
LUCY
INTO
ANOTHER
ROOM
WHICH
HAD
BY
NOW
BEEN
PREPARED
AND
LAIDHER
IN
BED
AND
FORCED
A
FEW
DROPS
OF
BRANDY
DOWN
HER
THROAT
I
NOTICEDTHAT
VAN
HELSING
TIED
A
SOFT
SILK
HANDKERCHIEF
ROUND
HER
THROAT
SHE
WASSTILL
UNCONSCIOUS
AND
WAS
QUITE
AS
BAD
AS
IF
NOT
WORSE
THAN
WE
HADEVER
SEEN
HER
VAN
HELSING
CALLED
IN
ONE
OF
THE
WOMEN
AND
TOLD
HER
TO
STAY
WITH
HERAND
NOT
TO
TAKE
HER
EYES
OFF
HER
TILL
WE
RETURNED
AND
THEN
BECKONED
MEOUT
OF
THE
ROOM
WE
MUST
CONSULT
AS
TO
WHAT
IS
TO
BE
DONE
HE
SAID
AS
WE
DESCENDED
THESTAIRS
IN
THE
HALL
HE
OPENED
THE
DINING
ROOM

AND
WE
PASSED
IN
HECLOSING
THE

CAREFULLY
BEHIND
HIM
THE

BEEN
OPENED
BUTTHE
BLINDS
WERE
ALREADY
DOWN
WITH
THAT
OBEDIENCE
TO
THE
ETIQUETTE
OFDEATH
WHICH
THE
BRITISH
WOMAN
OF

RIGIDLYOBSERVES
THE

THEREFORE
DIMLY
DARK
IT

HOWEVER
LIGHTENOUGH
FOR
OUR
PURPOSES
VAN
HELSING
S
STERNNESS
WAS
SOMEWHAT
RELIEVEDBY
A
LOOK
OF
PERPLEXITY
HE
WAS
EVIDENTLY
TORTURING
HIS
MIND
ABOUTSOMETHING
SO
I
WAITED
FOR
AN
INSTANT
AND
HE
SPOKE
WHAT
ARE
WE
TO
DO
NOW
WHERE
ARE

FOR
HELP
WE
MUST
HAVEANOTHER
TRANSFUSION
OF

VAN

STRODE
FORWARD

STRAIGHT
INTHE

HE
SAID
A
BRAVE

WITH
THE
DETAILS
LUCY
HAD
GOT
A
TERRIBLE
SHOCK
AND
ITTOLD
ON

MORE
THAN

FOR
THOUGH
PLENTY
OF

NOT
RESPOND
TO
THE
TREATMENT
AS
WELL
AS
ON
THE
OTHEROCCASIONS
HER
STRUGGLE
BACK
INTO
LIFE
WAS
SOMETHING
FRIGHTFUL
TO
SEEAND
HEAR
HOWEVER
THE
ACTION
OF
BOTH
HEART
AND
LUNGS
IMPROVED
AND
VANHELSING
MADE
A
SUBCUTANEOUS
INJECTION
OF
MORPHIA
AS
BEFORE
AND
WITHGOOD
EFFECT
HER
FAINT
BECAME
A
PROFOUND
SLUMBER
THE
PROFESSOR
WATCHEDWHILST

INTO
THE
BREAKFAST
ROOM
WHERETHE
BLINDS
WERE
NOT
DRAWN
DOWN

AND
THAT
A

IGNORANCE
OF

SURROUND
HER
INTENSIFIED
HIS
PAIN
HIS
VERYHEART
WAS
BLEEDING
AND
IT
TOOK
ALL
THE

OF
HIM
AND
THERE
WAS
AROYAL
LOT
OF
IT
TOO
TO
KEEP
HIM
FROM
BREAKING
DOWN
I
PAUSED
BEFOREANSWERING
FOR
I
FELT
THAT
I
MUST
NOT

BUT
ALREADY
HE
KNEW
SO
MUCH
AND
GUESSEDSO
MUCH
THAT

NO
REASON
FOR
NOT
ANSWERING

GAVE
A
LOUD
CRY
AND
PUT

DOUBTLESS
SYMPATHY
EASED
HER
SOMEWHAT
BUTSHE
WAS
VERY
LOW
IN

FORA
LONG
TIME

TOLD
HER
THAT
EITHER

REMAIN
WITHHER
ALL
THE
TIME
AND
THAT
SEEMED
TO

IN
TWO
VAN

HOWEVER
SHE
WENT
ONWITH
THE
ACTION
OF
TEARING
AS
THOUGH

STILL
IN

FINALLY
SHE
LIFTED
HER
HANDS
AND
OPENED
THEM
AS
THOUGH
SCATTERINGTHE
FRAGMENTS
VAN

SEEMED
SURPRISED
AND
HIS

ASIF
IN

BUT
HE
SAID
NOTHING
SEPTEMBER
ALL
LAST
NIGHT
SHE
SLEPT
FITFULLY
BEING
ALWAYS
AFRAIDTO
SLEEP
AND
SOMETHING
WEAKER
WHEN
SHE

FROM

ANDI
TOOK
IT
IN
TURNS
TO
WATCH
AND
WE
NEVER
LEFT
HER
FOR
A
MOMENTUNATTENDED
QUINCEY
MORRIS

NOTHING
ABOUT

BUT
I
KNEWTHAT

PATROLLED
ROUND

ROUND
THE

WHEN
THE
DAY
CAME
ITS
SEARCHING
LIGHT
SHOWED
THE

WAS
HARDLY
ABLE
TO

WHICH
SHE
COULD
TAKE
SEEMED
TO
DO

NO
GOOD
AT

SHESLEPT
AND
BOTH
VAN
HELSING
AND
I
NOTICED
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
HER
BETWEENSLEEPING
AND
WAKING
WHILST
ASLEEP
SHE
LOOKED
STRONGER
ALTHOUGH
MOREHAGGARD
AND
HER
BREATHING
WAS
SOFTER
HER
OPEN
MOUTH
SHOWED
THE
PALEGUMS
DRAWN
BACK
FROM
THE
TEETH
WHICH
THUS
LOOKED
POSITIVELY
LONGER
ANDSHARPER
THAN
USUAL
WHEN
SHE
WOKE
THE
SOFTNESS
OF
HER
EYES
EVIDENTLYCHANGED
THE
EXPRESSION
FOR
SHE
LOOKED
HER
OWN
SELF
ALTHOUGH
A
DYINGONE
IN
THE
AFTERNOON
SHE
ASKED
FOR
ARTHUR
AND
WE
TELEGRAPHED
FOR
HIM
QUINCEY
WENT

FULLAND
WARM
AND
THE
RED
LIGHT
STREAMED
IN
THROUGH
THE

AND
GAVE
MORECOLOUR
TO
THE
PALE
CHEEKS
WHEN
HE
SAW
HER
ARTHUR

SIMPLY
CHOKINGWITH
EMOTION
AND
NONE
OF

COULD
SPEAK
IN
THE

THAT
HAD
PASSED
THE
FITS
OF
SLEEP
OR
THE
COMATOSE
CONDITION
THAT
PASSED
FOR
IT
HADGROWN
MORE
FREQUENT
SO
THAT
THE
PAUSES
WHEN

WAS
POSSIBLEWERE
SHORTENED
ARTHUR
S
PRESENCE
HOWEVER
SEEMED
TO
ACT
AS
ASTIMULANT
SHE
RALLIED
A
LITTLE
AND
SPOKE
TO
HIM
MORE
BRIGHTLY
THAN
SHEHAD
DONE
SINCE
WE
ARRIVED
HE
TOO
PULLED
HIMSELF
TOGETHER
AND
SPOKE
ASCHEERILY
AS
HE
COULD
SO
THAT
THE

BY
TELLING

AFOUL
MOUTHED

IF
HE
WERE
TOSWING
FOR

I
OPENED
THE
WINDOW
AND
SIGNED
TO
THE

NOT

SO
HE
CONTENTED
HIMSELF
AFTER
LOOKING
THE
PLACE
OVER
AND
MAKING
UP
HISMIND
AS
TO
WHAT
KIND
OF
A
PLACE
HE
HAD
GOT
TO
BY
SAYING
LOR
BLESSYER
SIR
I
WOULDN
T
MIND
WHAT
WAS
SAID
TO
ME
IN
A
BLOOMIN
MADHOUSE
IPITY
YE
AND
THE
GUV
NOR
FOR
HAVIN
TO
LIVE
IN
THE

WITH
A
WILDBEAST
LIKE

THEN
HE
ASKED
HIS
WAY
CIVILLY
ENOUGH
AND
I
TOLD
HIMWHERE
THE
GATE
OF
THE
EMPTY
HOUSE
WAS
HE
WENT
AWAY
FOLLOWED
BY
THREATSAND
CURSES
AND
REVILINGS
FROM
OUR
MAN
I
WENT
DOWN
TO
SEE
IF
I
COULDMAKE
OUT
ANY
CAUSE
FOR
HIS
ANGER
SINCE
HE
IS
USUALLY
SUCH
AWELL
BEHAVED
MAN
AND
EXCEPT
HIS
VIOLENT
FITS
NOTHING
OF
THE
KIND
HADEVER
OCCURRED
I
FOUND
HIM
TO
MY
ASTONISHMENT
QUITE
COMPOSED
AND
MOSTGENIAL
IN
HIS
MANNER
I
TRIED
TO
GET
HIM
TO
TALK
OF
THE
INCIDENT
BUT
HEBLANDLY
ASKED
ME
QUESTIONS
AS
TO
WHAT
I
MEANT
AND
LED
ME
TO
BELIEVETHAT
HE
WAS
COMPLETELY
OBLIVIOUS
OF
THE
AFFAIR
IT
WAS
I
AM
SORRY
TOSAY
HOWEVER
ONLY
ANOTHER
INSTANCE
OF
HIS
CUNNING
FOR
WITHIN
HALF
ANHOUR
I
HEARD
OF
HIM
AGAIN
THIS
TIME
HE
HAD
BROKEN
OUT
THROUGH
THEWINDOW
OF
HIS
ROOM
AND
WAS
RUNNING
DOWN
THE
AVENUE
I
CALLED
TO
THEATTENDANTS
TO
FOLLOW
ME
AND
RAN
AFTER
HIM
FOR
I
FEARED
HE
WAS
INTENTON
SOME
MISCHIEF
MY
FEAR
WAS
JUSTIFIED
WHEN
I
SAW
THE
SAME
CART
WHICHHAD
PASSED
BEFORE
COMING
DOWN
THE
ROAD
HAVING
ON
IT
SOME
GREAT
WOODENBOXES
THE
MEN
WERE
WIPING
THEIR
FOREHEADS
AND
WERE
FLUSHED
IN
THEFACE
AS
IF
WITH
VIOLENT
EXERCISE
BEFORE
I
COULD
GET
UP
TO
HIM
THEPATIENT
RUSHED
AT
THEM
AND
PULLING
ONE
OF
THEM
OFF
THE
CART
BEGAN
TOKNOCK
HIS
HEAD
AGAINST
THE
GROUND
IF
I
HAD
NOT
SEIZED
HIM
JUST
AT
THEMOMENT
I
BELIEVE
HE
WOULD
HAVE
KILLED
THE
MAN
THERE
AND
THEN
THE
OTHERFELLOW
JUMPED
DOWN
AND
STRUCK
HIM
OVER
THE
HEAD
WITH
THE
BUTT
END
OF
HISHEAVY
WHIP
IT
WAS
A
TERRIBLE
BLOW
BUT
HE
DID
NOT
SEEM
TO
MIND
IT
BUTSEIZED
HIM
ALSO
AND
STRUGGLED
WITH
THE
THREE
OF
US
PULLING
US
TO
ANDFRO
AS
IF
WE
WERE
KITTENS
YOU
KNOW
I
AM
NO
LIGHT
WEIGHT
AND
THE
OTHERSWERE
BOTH
BURLY
MEN
AT
FIRST
HE
WAS
SILENT
IN
HIS
FIGHTING
BUT
AS
WEBEGAN
TO
MASTER
HIM
AND
THE
ATTENDANTS
WERE
PUTTING
A
STRAIT
WAISTCOATON
HIM
HE
BEGAN
TO
SHOUT
I
LL
FRUSTRATE
THEM
THEY
SHAN
T
ROB
ME
THEY
SHAN
T
MURDER
ME
BY
INCHES
I
LL
FIGHT
FOR
MY
LORD
AND
MASTER
ANDALL
SORTS
OF
SIMILAR
INCOHERENT
RAVINGS
IT
WAS
WITH
VERY
CONSIDERABLEDIFFICULTY
THAT
THEY
GOT
HIM
BACK
TO
THE
HOUSE
AND
PUT
HIM
IN
THE
PADDEDROOM
ONE
OF
THE
ATTENDANTS
HARDY
HAD
A
FINGER
BROKEN
HOWEVER
I
SETIT
ALL
RIGHT
AND
HE
IS
GOING
ON
WELL
THE
TWO
CARRIERS
WERE
AT
FIRST
LOUD
IN
THEIR
THREATS
OF
ACTIONS
FORDAMAGES
AND
PROMISED
TO
RAIN
ALL
THE
PENALTIES
OF
THE
LAW
ON
US
THEIRTHREATS
WERE
HOWEVER
MINGLED
WITH
SOME
SORT
OF
INDIRECT
APOLOGY
FORTHE
DEFEAT
OF
THE
TWO
OF
THEM
BY
A
FEEBLE
MADMAN
THEY
SAID
THAT
IF
ITHAD
NOT
BEEN
FOR
THE
WAY
THEIR
STRENGTH
HAD
BEEN
SPENT
IN
CARRYING
ANDRAISING
THE
HEAVY
BOXES
TO
THE
CART
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
MADE
SHORT
WORK
OFHIM
THEY
GAVE
AS
ANOTHER
REASON
FOR
THEIR
DEFEAT
THE
EXTRAORDINARYSTATE
OF
DROUTH
TO
WHICH
THEY
HAD
BEEN
REDUCED
BY
THE
DUSTY
NATURE
OFTHEIR
OCCUPATION
AND
THE
REPREHENSIBLE
DISTANCE
FROM
THE

OF
THEIRLABOURS

AFTER

MORE
OF
THE

A

THEY
MADE

OF

SPIRITED
TOO
SICK
OF
THE
WORLDAND
ALL
IN
IT
INCLUDING
LIFE
ITSELF
THAT
I
WOULD
NOT
CARE
IF
I
HEARDTHIS
MOMENT
THE
FLAPPING
OF
THE
WINGS
OF
THE
ANGEL
OF
DEATH
AND
HE
HASBEEN
FLAPPING
THOSE
GRIM
WINGS
TO
SOME
PURPOSE
OF
LATE
LUCY
S
MOTHERAND
ARTHUR
S
FATHER
AND
NOW
LET
ME
GET
ON
WITH
MY
WORK
I
DULY
RELIEVED
VAN
HELSING
IN
HIS
WATCH
OVER
LUCY
WE
WANTED
ARTHUR
TOGO
TO
REST
ALSO
BUT
HE
REFUSED
AT
FIRST
IT
WAS
ONLY
WHEN
I
TOLD
HIMTHAT
WE
SHOULD
WANT
HIM
TO
HELP
US
DURING
THE
DAY
AND
THAT
WE
MUST
NOTALL
BREAK
DOWN
FOR
WANT
OF

LEST
LUCY
SHOULD
SUFFER
THAT
HE
AGREEDTO
GO
VAN

WAS
VERY
KIND
TO
HIM
COME
MY
CHILD
HE
SAID
COME
WITH
ME
YOU
ARE
SICK
AND
WEAK
AND
HAVE
HAD
MUCH
SORROW
AND
MUCHMENTAL
PAIN
AS
WELL
AS
THAT
TAX
ON
YOUR
STRENGTH
THAT
WE
KNOW
OF
YOUMUST
NOT
BE
ALONE
FOR
TO
BE
ALONE
IS
TO
BE
FULL
OF
FEARS
AND
ALARMS
COME
TO
THE
DRAWING
ROOM
WHERE
THERE
IS
A
BIG
FIRE
AND
THERE
ARE
TWOSOFAS
YOU
SHALL
LIE
ON
ONE
AND
I
ON
THE
OTHER
AND
OUR
SYMPATHY
WILLBE
COMFORT
TO
EACH
OTHER
EVEN
THOUGH
WE
DO
NOT
SPEAK
AND
EVEN
IF
WESLEEP
ARTHUR
WENT
OFF
WITH
HIM
CASTING
BACK
A
LONGING
LOOK
ON
LUCY
SFACE
WHICH
LAY
IN
HER
PILLOW
ALMOST
WHITER
THAN
THE
LAWN
SHE
LAYQUITE
STILL
AND
I
LOOKED
ROUND
THE
ROOM
TO
SEE
THAT
ALL
WAS
AS
ITSHOULD
BE
I
COULD
SEE
THAT
THE
PROFESSOR
HAD
CARRIED
OUT
IN
THIS
ROOM
AS
IN
THE
OTHER
HIS
PURPOSE
OF
USING
THE
GARLIC
THE
WHOLE
OF
THEWINDOW
SASHES
REEKED
WITH
IT
AND
ROUND
LUCY
S
NECK
OVER
THE
SILKHANDKERCHIEF
WHICH
VAN
HELSING
MADE
HER
KEEP
ON
WAS
A
ROUGH
CHAPLET
OFTHE
SAME
ODOROUS
FLOWERS
LUCY
WAS
BREATHING
SOMEWHAT
STERTOROUSLY
ANDHER
FACE
WAS
AT
ITS
WORST
FOR
THE
OPEN
MOUTH
SHOWED
THE
PALE
GUMS
HERTEETH
IN
THE
DIM
UNCERTAIN
LIGHT
SEEMED
LONGER
AND
SHARPER
THAN
THEYHAD
BEEN
IN
THE
MORNING
IN
PARTICULAR
BY
SOME
TRICK
OF
THE
LIGHT
THECANINE
TEETH
LOOKED
LONGER
AND
SHARPER
THAN
THE
REST
I
SAT
DOWN
BY
HER
AND
PRESENTLY
SHE
MOVED
UNEASILY
AT
THE
SAME
MOMENT
THERE
CAME
A
SORTOF
DULL
FLAPPING
OR
BUFFETING
AT
THE
WINDOW
I
WENT
OVER
TO
IT
SOFTLY
AND
PEEPED
OUT
BY
THE
CORNER
OF
THE
BLIND
THERE
WAS
A
FULL
MOONLIGHT
AND
I
COULD
SEE
THAT
THE
NOISE
WAS
MADE
BY
A
GREAT
BAT
WHICH
WHEELEDROUND
DOUBTLESS
ATTRACTED
BY
THE
LIGHT
ALTHOUGH
SO
DIM
AND
EVERY
NOWAND
AGAIN
STRUCK
THE
WINDOW
WITH
ITS
WINGS
WHEN
I
CAME
BACK
TO
MY
SEAT
I
FOUND
THAT
LUCY
HAD
MOVED
SLIGHTLY
AND
HAD
TORN
AWAY
THE
GARLICFLOWERS
FROM
HER
THROAT
I
REPLACED
THEM
AS
WELL
AS
I
COULD
AND
SATWATCHING
HER
PRESENTLY
SHE
WOKE
AND
I
GAVE
HER
FOOD
AS
VAN
HELSING
HAD
PRESCRIBED
SHE
TOOK
BUT
A
LITTLE
AND
THAT
LANGUIDLY
THERE
DID
NOT
SEEM
TO
BE
WITHHER
NOW
THE
UNCONSCIOUS
STRUGGLE
FOR
LIFE
AND
STRENGTH
THAT
HAD
HITHERTOSO
MARKED
HER
ILLNESS
IT
STRUCK
ME
AS
CURIOUS
THAT
THE
MOMENT
SHEBECAME
CONSCIOUS
SHE
PRESSED
THE
GARLIC
FLOWERS
CLOSE
TO
HER
IT
WASCERTAINLY
ODD
THAT
WHENEVER
SHE
GOT
INTO
THAT
LETHARGIC
STATE
WITH
THESTERTOROUS
BREATHING
SHE
PUT
THE
FLOWERS
FROM
HER
BUT
THAT
WHEN
SHEWAKED
SHE
CLUTCHED
THEM
CLOSE
THERE
WAS
NO
POSSIBILITY
OF
MAKING
ANYMISTAKE
ABOUT
THIS
FOR
IN
THE
LONG
HOURS
THAT
FOLLOWED
SHE
HAD
MANYSPELLS
OF
SLEEPING
AND
WAKING
AND
REPEATED
BOTH
ACTIONS
MANY
TIMES
AT
SIX
O
CLOCK
VAN
HELSING
CAME
TO
RELIEVE
ME
ARTHUR
HAD
THEN
FALLENINTO
A
DOZE
AND
HE
MERCIFULLY
LET
HIM
SLEEP
ON
WHEN
HE
SAW
LUCY
S
FACEI
COULD
HEAR
THE
SISSING
INDRAW
OF
HIS
BREATH
AND
HE
SAID
TO
ME
IN
ASHARP
WHISPER
DRAW
UP
THE
BLIND
I
WANT
LIGHT
THEN
HE
BENT
DOWN
AND
WITH
HIS
FACE
ALMOST
TOUCHING
LUCY
S
EXAMINED
HER
CAREFULLY
HEREMOVED
THE
FLOWERS
AND
LIFTED
THE
SILK
HANDKERCHIEF
FROM
HER
THROAT
ASHE
DID
SO
HE
STARTED
BACK
AND
I
COULD
HEAR
HIS
EJACULATION
MEINGOTT
AS
IT
WAS
SMOTHERED
IN
HIS
THROAT
I
BENT
OVER
AND
LOOKED
TOO
AND
AS
I
NOTICED
SOME
QUEER
CHILL

OVER
ME
THE
WOUNDS
ON
THE
THROAT

ABSOLUTELY
DISAPPEARED
FOR
FULLY
FIVE
MINUTES
VAN
HELSING
STOOD
LOOKING
AT

WITH
HIS
FACEAT

STERNEST
THEN
HE
TURNED
TO
ME
AND
SAID
CALMLY
SHE

NOT
BE
LONG

WHETHER

DIES
CONSCIOUS

TO
THE
DINING

AND
WAKED

WAS
DAZED
FOR
A
MOMENT
BUTWHEN
HE
SAW
THE
SUNLIGHT
STREAMING
IN
THROUGH
THE
EDGES
OF
THE
SHUTTERSHE
THOUGHT
HE
WAS
LATE
AND
EXPRESSED
HIS
FEAR
I
ASSURED
HIM
THAT
LUCYWAS
STILL
ASLEEP
BUT
TOLD
HIM
AS
GENTLY
AS
I
COULD
THAT
BOTH
VANHELSING
AND
I
FEARED
THAT
THE
END
WAS
NEAR
HE
COVERED
HIS
FACE
WITH
HISHANDS
AND
SLID
DOWN
ON
HIS
KNEES
BY
THE
SOFA
WHERE
HE
REMAINED
PERHAPS
A
MINUTE
WITH
HIS
HEAD
BURIED
PRAYING
WHILST

WITH
GRIEF
I
TOOK

WILL
BE
BESTAND
EASIEST
FOR

WHEN
WE
CAME
INTO

I
COULD
SEE
THAT
VAN
HELSING
HAD
WITHHIS
USUAL
FORETHOUGHT
BEEN
PUTTING
MATTERS
STRAIGHT
AND
MAKINGEVERYTHING
LOOK
AS
PLEASING
AS
POSSIBLE
HE
HAD
EVEN
BRUSHED
LUCY
SHAIR
SO
THAT
IT
LAY
ON
THE
PILLOW
IN
ITS
USUAL
SUNNY
RIPPLES
WHEN
WECAME
INTO

SHE
LOOKED

WITH
ALL
THE
SOFT
LINES
MATCHING
THE
ANGELIC
BEAUTY
OF
HER

THENGRADUALLY
HER
EYES
CLOSED
AND
SHE
SANK
TO
SLEEP
FOR
A
LITTLE
BIT
HERBREAST
HEAVED
SOFTLY
AND
HER
BREATH
CAME
AND
WENT
LIKE
A
TIRED
CHILD
S
AND
THEN
INSENSIBLY
THERE
CAME
THE
STRANGE
CHANGE
WHICH
I
HAD
NOTICED
INTHE
NIGHT
HER
BREATHING
GREW
STERTOROUS
THE
MOUTH
OPENED
AND
THE
PALEGUMS
DRAWN
BACK
MADE
THE
TEETH
LOOK
LONGER
AND
SHARPER
THAN
EVER
IN
ASORT
OF
SLEEP
WAKING
VAGUE
UNCONSCIOUS
WAY
SHE
OPENED
HER
EYES
WHICHWERE
NOW
DULL
AND
HARD
AT
ONCE
AND
SAID
IN
A
SOFT
VOLUPTUOUS
VOICE
SUCH
AS

LIPS
ARTHUR
OH

BUT
AT
THAT
INSTANT
VAN

BEEN
STARTLED
BY
HER
VOICE
SWOOPED
UPON
HIM
AND
CATCHING
HIM
BYTHE
NECK
WITH
BOTH
HANDS
DRAGGED
HIM
BACK
WITH
A
FURY
OF
STRENGTH
WHICHI
NEVER

HAVE
POSSESSED
AND
ACTUALLY
HURLED
HIM
ALMOSTACROSS
THE
ROOM
NOT
FOR
YOUR
LIFE
HE
SAID
NOT
FOR
YOUR
LIVING
SOUL
AND
HERS
ANDHE
STOOD
BETWEEN
THEM
LIKE
A
LION
AT

ARTHUR
WAS
SO
TAKEN
ABACK
THAT
HE
DID
NOT
FOR
A
MOMENT
KNOW
WHAT
TO
DOOR
SAY
AND
BEFORE
ANY
IMPULSE
OF
VIOLENCE
COULD
SEIZE
HIM
HE
REALISEDTHE
PLACE
AND
THE
OCCASION
AND
STOOD
SILENT
WAITING
I
KEPT
MY
EYES
FIXED
ON
LUCY
AS
DID
VAN

AND
WE
SAW
A
SPASM
ASOF
RAGE
FLIT
LIKE
A
SHADOW
OVER
HER
FACE
THE
SHARP
TEETH
CHAMPEDTOGETHER
THEN
HER
EYES
CLOSED
AND
SHE
BREATHED
HEAVILY
VERY
SHORTLY
AFTER

SOFTNESS
ANDPUTTING

BUT
WITH
UNTELLABLE
PATHOS
MY

HE
SAID
SOLEMNLY
KNEELING
BESIDE
HER
AND
HOLDING
UP
HISHAND
AS
ONE
WHO
REGISTERS
AN
OATH
THEN
HE

ON
THEFOREHEAD
AND
ONLY

AND
SO
THEY
PARTED

CLOSED
AND
VAN

HAD
GONE
TO
MAKE
THE
HARSHNESS
OF

SO
THAT

ANDHER
MOTHER
MIGHT
BE
BURIED
TOGETHER
I
ATTENDED
TO
ALL
THE
GHASTLYFORMALITIES
AND
THE
URBANE
UNDERTAKER
PROVED
THAT
HIS
STAFF
WEREAFFLICTED
OR
BLESSED
WITH
SOMETHING
OF
HIS
OWN
OBSEQUIOUS
SUAVITY
EVEN
THE
WOMAN
WHO
PERFORMED

IN
A

PROFESSIONAL
WAY
WHEN

A
VERY
BEAUTIFUL
CORPSE
SIR
IT
S
QUITE
A
PRIVILEGE
TOATTEND
ON

IT
S
NOT
TOO
MUCH
TO

I
NOTICED
THAT
VAN
HELSING
NEVER
KEPT
FAR
AWAY
THIS
WAS
POSSIBLE
FROMTHE
DISORDERED
STATE
OF
THINGS
IN
THE
HOUSEHOLD
THERE
WERE
NO
RELATIVESAT

AND
AS
ARTHUR
HAD
TO
BE
BACK
THE

DAY
TO
ATTEND
AT
HISFATHER
S
FUNERAL
WE
WERE
UNABLE
TO
NOTIFY
ANY

BEENBIDDEN
UNDER

AND
I
TOOK
IT
UPONOURSELVES
TO
EXAMINE

ETC
HE
INSISTED
UPON
LOOKING
OVER
LUCY
SPAPERS
HIMSELF
I
ASKED
HIM
WHY
FOR
I
FEARED
THAT
HE
BEING
AFOREIGNER
MIGHT
NOT
BE
QUITE
AWARE
OF
ENGLISH
LEGAL
REQUIREMENTS
ANDSO
MIGHT
IN
IGNORANCE
MAKE
SOME
UNNECESSARY
TROUBLE
HE
ANSWERED
ME
I
KNOW
I
KNOW
YOU
FORGET
THAT
I
AM
A
LAWYER
AS
WELL
AS
A
DOCTOR
BUTTHIS
IS
NOT
ALTOGETHER
FOR
THE
LAW
YOU
KNEW
THAT
WHEN
YOU
AVOIDED

I
HAVE
MORE
THAN

THERE
MAY
BE

SUCHAS
THIS
AS
HE
SPOKE
HE

FROM
HIS

IN

WITHOUTMOVING
I
SAW
ONE
OF
THE
MAIDS
PASS
SILENTLY
ALONG
THE
PASSAGE
SHE

BACK
TOWARDS

SO
DID
NOT

IS
SO
RARE
AND
WE

SO
GRATEFULTO
THOSE

NATURALLY
HAD

WATCHALONE
BY
THE
BIER
OF

WHOM

SO
THAT
THE

TILL
LAID
TO

I
MUST
HAVE
SLEPT
LONG
AND
SOUNDLY
FOR

DAYLIGHT
WHEN

ME
BY
COMING
INTO
MY

ANDSAID
YOU

I
ASKED
FOR
HIS
SOLEMNITY
OF
THE
NIGHT

GREATLYIMPRESSED
ME
BECAUSE
HE
SAID
STERNLY
IT

TOO
LATE
OR
TOO
EARLY
SEE
HERE
HEHELD
UP
THE
LITTLE
GOLDEN
CRUCIFIX
THIS
WAS
STOLEN
IN
THE
NIGHT
HOW
STOLEN
I
ASKED
IN
WONDER
SINCE
YOU
HAVE
IT
NOW
BECAUSE
I
GET
IT
BACK
FROM
THE
WORTHLESS
WRETCH
WHO
STOLE
IT
FROM
THEWOMAN
WHO
ROBBED
THE
DEAD
AND
THE
LIVING
HER
PUNISHMENT
WILL
SURELYCOME
BUT
NOT
THROUGH
ME
SHE
KNEW
NOT
ALTOGETHER
WHAT
SHE
DID
AND
THUSUNKNOWING
SHE
ONLY
STOLE
NOW
WE
MUST
WAIT
HE
WENT
AWAY
ON
THE
WORD
LEAVING
ME
WITH
A
NEW
MYSTERY
TO
THINK
OF
ANEW
PUZZLE
TO
GRAPPLE
WITH
THE
FORENOON
WAS
A
DREARY
TIME
BUT
AT
NOON
THE
SOLICITOR
CAME
MR
MARQUAND
OF
WHOLEMAN
SONS
MARQUAND
LIDDERDALE
HE
WAS
VERY
GENIALAND
VERY
APPRECIATIVE
OF
WHAT
WE
HAD
DONE
AND
TOOK
OFF
OUR
HANDS
ALLCARES
AS
TO
DETAILS
DURING
LUNCH
HE
TOLD
US
THAT
MRS
WESTENRA
HAD
FORSOME
TIME
EXPECTED
SUDDEN
DEATH
FROM
HER
HEART
AND
HAD
PUT
HER
AFFAIRSIN
ABSOLUTE
ORDER
HE
INFORMED
US
THAT
WITH
THE
EXCEPTION
OF
A
CERTAINENTAILED
PROPERTY
OF
LUCY
S
FATHER
S
WHICH
NOW
IN
DEFAULT
OF
DIRECTISSUE
WENT
BACK
TO
A
DISTANT
BRANCH
OF
THE
FAMILY
THE
WHOLE
ESTATE
REAL
AND
PERSONAL
WAS
LEFT
ABSOLUTELY
TO
ARTHUR
HOLMWOOD
WHEN
HE
HADTOLD
US
SO
MUCH
HE
WENT
ON
FRANKLY
WE
DID
OUR
BEST
TO
PREVENT
SUCH
A
TESTAMENTARY
DISPOSITION
ANDPOINTED
OUT
CERTAIN
CONTINGENCIES
THAT
MIGHT
LEAVE
HER
DAUGHTER
EITHERPENNILESS
OR
NOT
SO
FREE
AS
SHE
SHOULD
BE
TO
ACT
REGARDING
A
MATRIMONIALALLIANCE
INDEED
WE
PRESSED
THE
MATTER
SO
FAR
THAT
WE
ALMOST
CAME
INTOCOLLISION
FOR
SHE
ASKED
US
IF
WE
WERE
OR
WERE
NOT
PREPARED
TO
CARRY
OUTHER
WISHES
OF
COURSE
WE
HAD
THEN
NO
ALTERNATIVE
BUT
TO
ACCEPT
WE
WERERIGHT
IN
PRINCIPLE
AND
NINETY
NINE
TIMES
OUT
OF
A
HUNDRED
WE
SHOULDHAVE
PROVED
BY
THE
LOGIC
OF
EVENTS
THE
ACCURACY
OF
OUR
JUDGMENT
FRANKLY
HOWEVER
I
MUST
ADMIT
THAT
IN
THIS
CASE
ANY
OTHER
FORM
OFDISPOSITION
WOULD
HAVE
RENDERED
IMPOSSIBLE
THE
CARRYING
OUT
OF
HERWISHES
FOR
BY
HER
PREDECEASING
HER
DAUGHTER
THE
LATTER
WOULD
HAVE
COMEINTO
POSSESSION
OF
THE
PROPERTY
AND
EVEN
HAD
SHE
ONLY
SURVIVED
HERMOTHER
BY
FIVE
MINUTES
HER
PROPERTY
WOULD
IN
CASE
THERE
WERE
NOWILL
AND
A
WILL
WAS
A
PRACTICAL
IMPOSSIBILITY
IN
SUCH
A
CASE
HAVE
BEENTREATED
AT
HER
DECEASE
AS
UNDER
INTESTACY
IN
WHICH
CASE
LORD
GODALMING
THOUGH
SO
DEAR
A
FRIEND
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
NO
CLAIM
IN
THE
WORLD
AND
THEINHERITORS
BEING
REMOTE
WOULD
NOT
BE
LIKELY
TO
ABANDON
THEIR
JUSTRIGHTS
FOR
SENTIMENTAL
REASONS
REGARDING
AN
ENTIRE
STRANGER
I
ASSUREYOU
MY
DEAR
SIRS
I
AM
REJOICED
AT
THE
RESULT
PERFECTLY
REJOICED
HE
WAS
A
GOOD
FELLOW
BUT
HIS
REJOICING
AT
THE
ONE
LITTLE
PART
IN
WHICHHE
WAS
OFFICIALLY
INTERESTED
OF
SO
GREAT
A
TRAGEDY
WAS
ANOBJECT
LESSON
IN
THE
LIMITATIONS
OF
SYMPATHETIC
UNDERSTANDING
HE
DID
NOT
REMAIN
LONG
BUT
SAID
HE
WOULD
LOOK
IN
LATER
IN
THE
DAY
ANDSEE
LORD
GODALMING
HIS
COMING
HOWEVER
HAD
BEEN
A
CERTAIN
COMFORT
TOUS
SINCE
IT
ASSURED
US
THAT
WE
SHOULD
NOT
HAVE
TO
DREAD
HOSTILECRITICISM
AS
TO
ANY
OF
OUR
ACTS
ARTHUR
WAS
EXPECTED
AT
FIVE
O
CLOCK
SOA
LITTLE
BEFORE
THAT
TIME
WE
VISITED
THE
DEATH
CHAMBER
IT
WAS
SO
INVERY
TRUTH
FOR
NOW
BOTH
MOTHER
AND
DAUGHTER
LAY
IN
IT
THE
UNDERTAKER
TRUE
TO
HIS
CRAFT
HAD
MADE
THE
BEST
DISPLAY
HE
COULD
OF
HIS
GOODS
ANDTHERE
WAS
A
MORTUARY
AIR
ABOUT
THE
PLACE
THAT
LOWERED
OUR
SPIRITS
ATONCE
VAN
HELSING
ORDERED
THE
FORMER
ARRANGEMENT
TO
BE
ADHERED
TO
EXPLAINING
THAT
AS
LORD
GODALMING
WAS
COMING
VERY
SOON
IT
WOULD
BELESS
HARROWING
TO
HIS
FEELINGS
TO
SEE
ALL
THAT
WAS
LEFT
OF
HIS
FIANCEE
QUITE
ALONE
THE
UNDERTAKER
SEEMED
SHOCKED
AT
HIS
OWN
STUPIDITY
ANDEXERTED
HIMSELF
TO
RESTORE
THINGS
TO
THE
CONDITION
IN
WHICH
WE
LEFT
THEMTHE
NIGHT
BEFORE
SO
THAT
WHEN
ARTHUR
CAME
SUCH
SHOCKS
TO
HIS
FEELINGSAS
WE
COULD
AVOID
WERE
SAVED
POOR
FELLOW
HE
LOOKED
DESPERATELY
SAD
AND
BROKEN
EVEN
HIS
STALWARTMANHOOD
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
SHRUNK
SOMEWHAT
UNDER
THE
STRAIN
OF
HISMUCH
TRIED
EMOTIONS
HE
HAD
I
KNEW
BEEN
VERY
GENUINELY
AND
DEVOTEDLYATTACHED
TO
HIS
FATHER
AND
TO
LOSE
HIM
AND
AT
SUCH
A
TIME
WAS
ABITTER
BLOW
TO
HIM
WITH
ME
HE
WAS
WARM
AS
EVER
AND
TO
VAN
HELSING
HEWAS
SWEETLY
COURTEOUS
BUT
I
COULD
NOT
HELP
SEEING
THAT
THERE
WAS
SOMECONSTRAINT
WITH
HIM
THE
PROFESSOR
NOTICED
IT
TOO
AND
MOTIONED
ME
TOBRING
HIM
UPSTAIRS
I
DID
SO
AND
LEFT
HIM
AT
THE
DOOR
OF
THE
ROOM
AS
IFELT
HE
WOULD
LIKE
TO
BE
QUITE
ALONE
WITH
HER
BUT
HE
TOOK
MY
ARM
ANDLED
ME
IN
SAYING
HUSKILY
YOU
LOVED
HER
TOO
OLD
FELLOW
SHE
TOLD
ME
ALL
ABOUT
IT
AND
THERE
WASNO
FRIEND
HAD
A
CLOSER
PLACE
IN
HER
HEART
THAN
YOU
I
DON
T
KNOW
HOW
TOTHANK
YOU
FOR
ALL
YOU
HAVE
DONE
FOR
HER
I
CAN
T
THINK
YET
HERE
HE
SUDDENLY
BROKE
DOWN
AND
THREW
HIS
ARMS
ROUND
MY
SHOULDERS
ANDLAID
HIS
HEAD
ON
MY
BREAST
CRYING
OH
JACK
JACK
WHAT
SHALL
I
DO
THE
WHOLE
OF
LIFE
SEEMS
GONE
FROM
MEALL
AT
ONCE
AND
THERE
IS
NOTHING
IN
THE
WIDE
WORLD
FOR
ME
TO
LIVE
FOR
I
COMFORTED
HIM
AS
WELL
AS
I
COULD
IN
SUCH
CASES
MEN
DO
NOT
NEED
MUCHEXPRESSION
A
GRIP
OF
THE
HAND
THE
TIGHTENING
OF
AN
ARM
OVER
THESHOULDER
A
SOB
IN
UNISON
ARE
EXPRESSIONS
OF
SYMPATHY
DEAR
TO
A
MAN
SHEART
I
STOOD
STILL
AND
SILENT
TILL
HIS
SOBS
DIED
AWAY
AND
THEN
I
SAIDSOFTLY
TO
HIM
COME
AND
LOOK
AT
HER
TOGETHER
WE
MOVED
OVER
TO
THE
BED
AND
I
LIFTED
THE
LAWN
FROM
HER
FACE
GOD
HOW
BEAUTIFUL
SHE
WAS
EVERY
HOUR
SEEMED
TO
BE
ENHANCING
HERLOVELINESS
IT
FRIGHTENED
AND
AMAZED
ME
SOMEWHAT
AND
AS
FOR
ARTHUR
HEFELL
A
TREMBLING
AND
FINALLY
WAS
SHAKEN
WITH
DOUBT
AS
WITH
AN
AGUE
ATLAST
AFTER
A
LONG
PAUSE
HE
SAID
TO
ME
IN
A
FAINT
WHISPER
JACK
IS
SHE
REALLY
DEAD
I
ASSURED
HIM
SADLY
THAT
IT
WAS
SO
AND
WENT
ON
TO
SUGGEST
FOR
I
FELTTHAT
SUCH
A
HORRIBLE
DOUBT
SHOULD
NOT
HAVE
LIFE
FOR
A
MOMENT
LONGER
THANI
COULD
HELP
THAT
IT
OFTEN
HAPPENED
THAT
AFTER
DEATH
FACES
BECAMESOFTENED
AND
EVEN
RESOLVED
INTO
THEIR
YOUTHFUL
BEAUTY
THAT
THIS
WASESPECIALLY
SO
WHEN
DEATH
HAD
BEEN
PRECEDED
BY
ANY
ACUTE
OR
PROLONGEDSUFFERING
IT
SEEMED
TO
QUITE
DO
AWAY
WITH
ANY
DOUBT
AND
AFTERKNEELING
BESIDE
THE
COUCH
FOR
A
WHILE
AND
LOOKING
AT

LOVINGLY
ANDLONG
HE

ASIDE
I
TOLD
HIM
THAT
THAT
MUST
BE
GOOD
BYE
AS
THECOFFIN

BE
PREPARED
SO
HE
WENT
BACK
AND
TOOK
HER
DEAD
HAND
IN
HISAND
KISSED
IT
AND
BENT
OVER
AND
KISSED
HER
FOREHEAD
HE

AS

CAME
I
LEFT

IN
THE
DRAWING
ROOM

WHATUNEXPECTED
PROSPERITY

FOR

SO
IT
MAY

AS
WELL
TO
FRESHEN
IT
UPAGAIN
WITH
AN
EXERCISE
ANYHOW
THE
SERVICE
WAS
VERY
SIMPLE
AND
VERY
SOLEMN
THERE
WERE
ONLY
OURSELVESAND
THE
SERVANTS
THERE
ONE
OR
TWO
OLD
FRIENDS
OF
HIS
FROM
EXETER
HISLONDON
AGENT
AND
A
GENTLEMAN
REPRESENTING
SIR
JOHN
PAXTON
THEPRESIDENT
OF
THE
INCORPORATED
LAW
SOCIETY
JONATHAN
AND
I
STOOD
HAND
INHAND
AND
WE
FELT
THAT
OUR
BEST
AND
DEAREST
FRIEND
WAS
GONE
FROM
US
WE
CAME
BACK
TO
TOWN
QUIETLY
TAKING
A
BUS
TO
HYDE
PARK
CORNER
JONATHAN
THOUGHT
IT
WOULD
INTEREST
ME
TO
GO
INTO
THE
ROW
FOR
A
WHILE
SOWE
SAT
DOWN
BUT
THERE
WERE
VERY
FEW
PEOPLE
THERE
AND
IT
WASSAD
LOOKING
AND
DESOLATE
TO
SEE
SO
MANY
EMPTY
CHAIRS
IT
MADE
US
THINKOF
THE
EMPTY
CHAIR
AT
HOME
SO
WE
GOT
UP
AND
WALKED
DOWN
PICCADILLY
JONATHAN
WAS
HOLDING
ME
BY
THE
ARM
THE
WAY
HE
USED
TO
IN
OLD
DAYSBEFORE
I
WENT
TO
SCHOOL
I
FELT
IT
VERY
IMPROPER
FOR
YOU
CAN
T
GO
ONFOR
SOME
YEARS
TEACHING
ETIQUETTE
AND
DECORUM
TO
OTHER
GIRLS
WITHOUT
THEPEDANTRY
OF
IT
BITING
INTO
YOURSELF
A
BIT
BUT
IT
WAS
JONATHAN
AND
HEWAS
MY
HUSBAND
AND
WE
DIDN
T
KNOW
ANYBODY
WHO
SAW
US
AND
WE
DIDN
TCARE
IF
THEY
DID
SO
ON
WE
WALKED
I
WAS
LOOKING
AT
A
VERY
BEAUTIFULGIRL
IN
A
BIG
CART
WHEEL
HAT
SITTING
IN
A
VICTORIA
OUTSIDE
GUILIANO
S
WHEN
I
FELT
JONATHAN
CLUTCH
MY
ARM
SO
TIGHT
THAT
HE
HURT
ME
AND
HE
SAIDUNDER
HIS
BREATH
MY
GOD
I
AM
ALWAYS
ANXIOUS
ABOUT
JONATHAN
FOR
IFEAR
THAT
SOME
NERVOUS
FIT
MAY
UPSET
HIM
AGAIN
SO
I
TURNED
TO
HIMQUICKLY
AND
ASKED
HIM
WHAT
IT
WAS
THAT
DISTURBED
HIM
HE
WAS
VERY
PALE
AND
HIS
EYES
SEEMED
BULGING
OUT
AS
HALF
IN
TERROR
ANDHALF
IN
AMAZEMENT
HE
GAZED
AT
A
TALL
THIN
MAN
WITH
A
BEAKY
NOSE
ANDBLACK
MOUSTACHE
AND
POINTED
BEARD
WHO
WAS
ALSO
OBSERVING
THE
PRETTYGIRL
HE
WAS
LOOKING
AT
HER
SO
HARD
THAT
HE
DID
NOT
SEE
EITHER
OF
US
AND
SO
I
HAD
A
GOOD
VIEW
OF
HIM
HIS
FACE
WAS
NOT
A
GOOD
FACE
IT
WASHARD
AND
CRUEL
AND
SENSUAL
AND
HIS
BIG
WHITE
TEETH
THAT
LOOKED
ALLTHE
WHITER
BECAUSE
HIS
LIPS
WERE
SO
RED
WERE
POINTED
LIKE
AN
ANIMAL
S
JONATHAN
KEPT
STARING
AT
HIM
TILL
I
WAS
AFRAID
HE
WOULD
NOTICE
IFEARED
HE
MIGHT
TAKE
IT
ILL
HE
LOOKED
SO
FIERCE
AND
NASTY
I
ASKEDJONATHAN
WHY
HE
WAS
DISTURBED
AND
HE
ANSWERED
EVIDENTLY
THINKING
THATI
KNEW
AS
MUCH
ABOUT
IT
AS
HE
DID
DO
YOU
SEE
WHO
IT
IS
NO
DEAR
I
SAID
I
DON
T
KNOW
HIM
WHO
IS
IT
HIS
ANSWER
SEEMED
TOSHOCK
AND
THRILL
ME
FOR
IT
WAS
SAID
AS
IF
HE
DID
NOT
KNOW
THAT
IT
WASTO
ME
MINA
TO
WHOM
HE
WAS
SPEAKING
IT
IS
THE
MAN
HIMSELF
THE
POOR
DEAR
WAS
EVIDENTLY
TERRIFIED
AT
SOMETHING
VERY
GREATLYTERRIFIED
I
DO
BELIEVE
THAT
IF
HE
HAD
NOT
HAD
ME
TO
LEAN
ON
AND
TOSUPPORT
HIM
HE
WOULD
HAVE
SUNK
DOWN
HE
KEPT
STARING
A
MAN
CAME
OUT
OFTHE
SHOP
WITH
A
SMALL
PARCEL
AND
GAVE
IT
TO
THE
LADY
WHO
THEN
DROVEOFF
THE
DARK
MAN
KEPT
HIS
EYES
FIXED
ON
HER
AND
WHEN
THE
CARRIAGEMOVED
UP
PICCADILLY
HE
FOLLOWED
IN
THE
SAME
DIRECTION
AND
HAILED
AHANSOM
JONATHAN
KEPT
LOOKING
AFTER
HIM
AND
SAID
AS
IF
TO
HIMSELF
I
BELIEVE
IT
IS
THE
COUNT
BUT
HE
HAS
GROWN
YOUNG
MY
GOD
IF
THIS
BESO
OH
MY
GOD
MY
GOD
IF
I
ONLY
KNEW
IF
I
ONLY
KNEW
HE
WASDISTRESSING
HIMSELF
SO
MUCH
THAT
I
FEARED
TO
KEEP
HIS
MIND
ON
THESUBJECT
BY
ASKING
HIM
ANY
QUESTIONS
SO
I
REMAINED
SILENT
I
DREW
HIMAWAY
QUIETLY
AND
HE
HOLDING
MY
ARM
CAME
EASILY
WE
WALKED
A
LITTLEFURTHER
AND
THEN
WENT
IN
AND
SAT
FOR
A
WHILE
IN
THE
GREEN
PARK
IT
WASA
HOT
DAY
FOR
AUTUMN
AND
THERE
WAS
A
COMFORTABLE
SEAT
IN
A
SHADY
PLACE
AFTER
A
FEW
MINUTES
STARING
AT
NOTHING
JONATHAN
S
EYES
CLOSED
AND
HEWENT
QUIETLY
INTO
A
SLEEP
WITH
HIS
HEAD
ON
MY
SHOULDER
I
THOUGHT
ITWAS
THE
BEST
THING
FOR
HIM
SO
DID
NOT
DISTURB
HIM
IN
ABOUT
TWENTYMINUTES
HE
WOKE
UP
AND
SAID
TO
ME
QUITE
CHEERFULLY
WHY
MINA
HAVE
I
BEEN
ASLEEP
OH
DO
FORGIVE
ME
FOR
BEING
SO
RUDE
COME
AND
WE
LL
HAVE
A
CUP
OF
TEA
SOMEWHERE
HE
HAD
EVIDENTLY
FORGOTTENALL
ABOUT
THE
DARK
STRANGER
AS
IN
HIS
ILLNESS
HE
HAD
FORGOTTEN
ALL
THATTHIS
EPISODE
HAD
REMINDED
HIM
OF
I
DON
T
LIKE
THIS
LAPSING
INTOFORGETFULNESS
IT
MAY
MAKE
OR
CONTINUE
SOME
INJURY
TO
THE
BRAIN
I
MUSTNOT
ASK
HIM
FOR
FEAR
I
SHALL
DO
MORE
HARM
THAN
GOOD
BUT
I
MUST
SOMEHOWLEARN
THE
FACTS
OF
HIS
JOURNEY
ABROAD
THE
TIME

PARCEL
AND

WHY
AT
SUCH
A
TIME

WITH
ASERIES
OF

SEEM
TO

OF
WHATWAS

AS
THE

CASES
THE

WERE
TOO
YOUNG
TO

ANY

THE
CONSENSUS
OF
THEIR

THAT
THEY
HAD
BEEN
WITH

IT
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN

INTHE

HOW

I
AM
TO
SEE
MY

RISING
TO
THE

AND
KEEPING

IN

WITH

IS
ANY
TRUTHIN
IT
AT

DID
HE
GET
HIS

FEVER
AND
THEN
WRITE
ALL
THOSETERRIBLE

BITTER

THAT
FEARFUL

WASCOMING
TO
LONDON
IF
IT

AND
HE

WITH
A
COURTLYBOW
I
ASKED

ABOUT
SO
HE
ATONCE
BEGAN
I
HAVE
READ
YOUR

FORGIVE
ME
BUT
I
HAD
TO
BEGINTO
INQUIRE
SOMEWHERE
AND
THERE
WAS
NONE
TO
ASK
I
KNOW
THAT
YOU
WEREWITH
HER
AT

SHE
SOMETIMES
KEPT
A
DIARY
YOU
NEED
NOT
LOOKSURPRISED
MADAM
MINA
IT
WAS
BEGUN
AFTER
YOU
HAD
LEFT
AND
WAS
INIMITATION
OF
YOU
AND
IN
THAT
DIARY
SHE
TRACES
BY
INFERENCE
CERTAINTHINGS
TO
A
SLEEP
WALKING
IN
WHICH
SHE
PUTS
DOWN
THAT
YOU
SAVED

YOU
HAVE
GOOD
MEMORY
FOR
FACTS
FOR

IT
IS
NOT
ALWAYSSO
WITH
YOUNG
LADIES
NO
DOCTOR
BUT
I
WROTE
IT
ALL
DOWN
AT
THE
TIME
I
CAN
SHOW
IT
TO
YOUIF
YOU
LIKE
OH
MADAM
MINA
I
WILL
BE
GRATEFUL
YOU
WILL
DO
ME
MUCH
FAVOUR
ICOULD
NOT
RESIST
THE
TEMPTATION
OF
MYSTIFYING
HIM
A
BIT
I
SUPPOSE
IT
ISSOME
OF
THE
TASTE
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
APPLE
THAT
REMAINS
STILL
IN
OURMOUTHS
SO
I
HANDED
HIM
THE

TOOK
IT
WITH

GRATEFULBOW
AND

DEMURELY
AS
I
COULD
HE
OPENED
IT
AND
FORAN
INSTANT
HIS

FELL
THEN
HE
STOOD
UP
AND
BOWED
OH

I
KNEW
LONG
THAT
MR

ALL
THE

ALAS

HANDED

NOT

AS
FINALITY
NOT
A
WEEKSINCE
I
SAID
FINIS
AND
YET
HERE
I
AM
STARTING
FRESH
AGAIN
OR
RATHERGOING
ON
WITH
THE
SAME
RECORD
UNTIL
THIS
AFTERNOON
I
HAD
NO
CAUSE
TOTHINK
OF
WHAT
IS
DONE
RENFIELD
HAD
BECOME
TO
ALL
INTENTS
AS
SANE
ASHE
EVER
WAS
HE
WAS
ALREADY
WELL
AHEAD
WITH
HIS
FLY
BUSINESS
AND
HE
HADJUST
STARTED
IN
THE
SPIDER
LINE
ALSO
SO
HE
HAD
NOT
BEEN
OF
ANY
TROUBLETO
ME
I
HAD
A
LETTER
FROM
ARTHUR
WRITTEN
ON
SUNDAY
AND
FROM
IT
IGATHER
THAT
HE
IS
BEARING
UP
WONDERFULLY
WELL
QUINCEY
MORRIS

WITHHIM
AND
THAT
IS
MUCH
OF
A
HELP
FOR

A
BUBBLING
WELL
OFGOOD
SPIRITS
QUINCEY
WROTE
ME
A
LINE
TOO
AND
FROM
HIM
I
HEAR
THATARTHUR
IS
BEGINNING
TO
RECOVER
SOMETHING
OF
HIS
OLD
BUOYANCY
SO
AS
TOTHEM
ALL
MY
MIND
IS
AT
REST
AS
FOR
MYSELF
I
WAS
SETTLING
DOWN
TO
MYWORK
WITH
THE
ENTHUSIASM
WHICH
I
USED
TO
HAVE
FOR
IT
SO
THAT
I
MIGHTFAIRLY
HAVE
SAID
THAT
THE
WOUND
WHICH
POOR
LUCY
LEFT
ON
ME
WAS
BECOMINGCICATRISED
EVERYTHING
IS
HOWEVER
NOW
REOPENED
AND
WHAT
IS
TO
BE
THEEND
GOD
ONLY
KNOWS
I
HAVE
AN
IDEA
THAT
VAN
HELSING
THINKS
HE
KNOWS
TOO
BUT
HE
WILL
ONLY
LET
OUT
ENOUGH
AT
A
TIME
TO
WHET
CURIOSITY
HEWENT
TO
EXETER
YESTERDAY
AND
STAYED
THERE
ALL
NIGHT
TO
DAY
HE
CAMEBACK
AND
ALMOST
BOUNDED
INTO
THE
ROOM
AT
ABOUT
HALF
PAST
FIVE
O
CLOCK
AND
THRUST
LAST
NIGHT
S
WESTMINSTER
GAZETTE
INTO
MY
HAND
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
OF
THAT
HE
ASKED
AS
HE
STOOD
BACK
AND
FOLDED
HISARMS
I
LOOKED
OVER
THE
PAPER
FOR
I
REALLY
DID
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
HE
MEANT
BUT
HETOOK
IT
FROM
ME
AND
POINTED
OUT
A
PARAGRAPH
ABOUT
CHILDREN
BEING
DECOYEDAWAY
AT
HAMPSTEAD
IT
DID
NOT
CONVEY
MUCH
TO
ME
UNTIL
I
REACHED
APASSAGE
WHERE
IT
DESCRIBED
SMALL
PUNCTURED
WOUNDS
ON
THEIR
THROATS
ANIDEA
STRUCK
ME
AND
I
LOOKED
UP
WELL
HE
SAID
IT
IS
LIKE
POOR
LUCY
S
AND
WHAT
DO
YOU
MAKE
OF
IT
SIMPLY
THAT
THERE
IS
SOME
CAUSE
IN
COMMON
WHATEVER
IT
WAS
THAT
INJUREDHER
HAS
INJURED
THEM
I
DID
NOT
QUITE
UNDERSTAND
HIS
ANSWER
THAT
IS
TRUE
INDIRECTLY
BUT
NOT
DIRECTLY
HOW
DO
YOU
MEAN
PROFESSOR
I
ASKED
I
WAS
A
LITTLE
INCLINED
TO
TAKEHIS
SERIOUSNESS
LIGHTLY
FOR
AFTER
ALL
FOUR
DAYS
OF
REST
AND
FREEDOMFROM
BURNING
HARROWING
ANXIETY
DOES
HELP
TO
RESTORE
ONE
S
SPIRITS
BUTWHEN
I
SAW
HIS
FACE
IT
SOBERED
ME
NEVER
EVEN
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
OURDESPAIR
ABOUT
POOR
LUCY
HAD
HE
LOOKED
MORE
STERN
TELL
ME
I
SAID
I
CAN
HAZARD
NO
OPINION
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
TOTHINK
AND
I
HAVE
NO
DATA
ON
WHICH
TO
FOUND
A
CONJECTURE
DO
YOU
MEAN
TO
TELL
ME
FRIEND
JOHN
THAT
YOU
HAVE
NO
SUSPICION
AS
TOWHAT
POOR
LUCY
DIED
OF
NOT
AFTER
ALL
THE
HINTS
GIVEN
NOT
ONLY
BYEVENTS
BUT
BY
ME
OF
NERVOUS
PROSTRATION
FOLLOWING
ON
GREAT
LOSS
OR
WASTE
OF
BLOOD
AND
HOW
THE
BLOOD
LOST
OR
WASTE
I
SHOOK
MY
HEAD
HE
STEPPED
OVER
ANDSAT
DOWN
BESIDE
ME
AND
WENT
ON
YOU
ARE
CLEVER
MAN
FRIEND
JOHN

REASON
WELL
AND
YOUR
WIT
IS
BOLD
BUT
YOU
ARE
TOO
PREJUDICED
YOU
DO
NOT
LET
YOUR
EYES
SEE
NOR
YOUR
EARSHEAR
AND
THAT
WHICH
IS
OUTSIDE
YOUR
DAILY
LIFE
IS
NOT
OF
ACCOUNT
TOYOU
DO
YOU
NOT
THINK
THAT
THERE
ARE
THINGS
WHICH
YOU
CANNOT
UNDERSTAND
AND
YET
WHICH
ARE
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
SEE
THINGS
THAT
OTHERS
CANNOT
BUTTHERE
ARE
THINGS
OLD
AND
NEW
WHICH
MUST
NOT
BE
CONTEMPLATE
BY
MEN
SEYES
BECAUSE
THEY
KNOW
OR
THINK
THEY
KNOW
SOME
THINGS
WHICH
OTHER
MENHAVE
TOLD
THEM
AH
IT
IS
THE
FAULT
OF
OUR
SCIENCE
THAT
IT
WANTS
TOEXPLAIN
ALL
AND
IF
IT
EXPLAIN
NOT
THEN
IT
SAYS
THERE
IS
NOTHING
TOEXPLAIN
BUT
YET
WE
SEE
AROUND
US
EVERY
DAY
THE
GROWTH
OF
NEW
BELIEFS
WHICH
THINK
THEMSELVES
NEW
AND
WHICH
ARE
YET
BUT
THE
OLD
WHICH
PRETENDTO
BE
YOUNG
LIKE
THE
FINE
LADIES

LET

TELL

MYFRIEND
THAT
THERE
ARE
THINGS

DO
YOU

DOYOU

AND
CAN
SAY
WHEREFORE
THEQUALITIES

AND
NOT
IN

CAN
YOU
TELL

WHEN
OTHER

THAT
ONE
GREAT
SPIDER
LIVEDFOR
CENTURIES
IN
THE

OF
THE
OLD

AND
GREW
AND
GREW
TILL
ON

HE
COULD
DRINK
THE
OIL
OF
ALL
THE

LAMPS
CANYOU
TELL
ME
WHY
IN
THE
PAMPAS
AY
AND
ELSEWHERE
THERE
ARE
BATS
THATCOME
AT
NIGHT
AND
OPEN
THE
VEINS
OF
CATTLE
AND
HORSES
AND
SUCK
DRY
THEIRVEINS
HOW
IN
SOME
ISLANDS
OF
THE
WESTERN
SEAS
THERE
ARE
BATS
WHICH
HANGON
THE
TREES
ALL
DAY
AND
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
SEEN
DESCRIBE
AS
LIKE
GIANTNUTS
OR
PODS
AND
THAT
WHEN
THE
SAILORS
SLEEP
ON
THE
DECK
BECAUSE
THATIT
IS
HOT
FLIT
DOWN

AND
THEN
AND
THEN
IN

AREFOUND
DEAD
MEN

AS
EVEN
MISS
LUCY
WAS
GOOD
GOD
PROFESSOR
I
SAID
STARTING
UP
DO
YOU
MEAN
TO
TELL
ME
THATLUCY
WAS
BITTEN
BY
SUCH
A
BAT
AND
THAT
SUCH
A
THING
IS
HERE
IN
LONDONIN
THE
NINETEENTH
CENTURY
HE
WAVED
HIS
HAND
FOR
SILENCE
AND
WENTON
CAN
YOU
TELL
ME
WHY
THE
TORTOISE
LIVES
MORE
LONG
THAN
GENERATIONS
OFMEN
WHY
THE
ELEPHANT
GOES
ON
AND
ON
TILL
HE
HAVE
SEEN
DYNASTIES
ANDWHY
THE
PARROT
NEVER
DIE
ONLY
OF
BITE
OF
CAT
OR
DOG
OR
OTHER
COMPLAINT
CAN
YOU
TELL
ME
WHY
MEN
BELIEVE
IN
ALL
AGES
AND
PLACES
THAT
THERE
ARESOME
FEW
WHO
LIVE
ON
ALWAYS
IF
THEY
BE
PERMIT
THAT
THERE
ARE
MEN
ANDWOMEN
WHO
CANNOT
DIE
WE
ALL
KNOW
BECAUSE
SCIENCE
HAS
VOUCHED
FOR
THEFACT
THAT
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
TOADS
SHUT
UP
IN
ROCKS
FOR
THOUSANDS
OFYEARS
SHUT
IN
ONE
SO
SMALL
HOLE
THAT
ONLY
HOLD
HIM
SINCE
THE
YOUTH
OFTHE
WORLD
CAN
YOU
TELL
ME
HOW
THE
INDIAN
FAKIR
CAN
MAKE
HIMSELF
TO
DIEAND
HAVE
BEEN
BURIED
AND
HIS
GRAVE
SEALED
AND
CORN
SOWED
ON
IT
AND
THECORN
REAPED
AND
BE
CUT
AND
SOWN
AND
REAPED
AND
CUT
AGAIN
AND
THEN
MENCOME
AND
TAKE
AWAY
THE
UNBROKEN
SEAL
AND
THAT
THERE
LIE
THE
INDIANFAKIR
NOT
DEAD
BUT
THAT
RISE
UP
AND
WALK
AMONGST
THEM
AS
BEFORE
HEREI
INTERRUPTED
HIM
I
WAS
GETTING
BEWILDERED
HE
SO
CROWDED
ON
MY
MINDHIS
LIST
OF
NATURE
S
ECCENTRICITIES
AND
POSSIBLE
IMPOSSIBILITIES
THAT
MYIMAGINATION
WAS
GETTING
FIRED
I
HAD
A
DIM
IDEA
THAT
HE
WAS
TEACHING
MESOME
LESSON
AS
LONG
AGO
HE
USED
TO
DO
IN
HIS
STUDY
AT
AMSTERDAM
BUTHE
USED
THEN
TO
TELL
ME
THE
THING
SO
THAT
I
COULD
HAVE
THE
OBJECT
OFTHOUGHT
IN
MIND
ALL
THE
TIME
BUT
NOW
I
WAS
WITHOUT
THIS
HELP
YET
IWANTED
TO
FOLLOW
HIM
SO
I
SAID
PROFESSOR
LET
ME
BE
YOUR
PET
STUDENT
AGAIN
TELL
ME
THE
THESIS
SOTHAT
I
MAY
APPLY
YOUR
KNOWLEDGE
AS
YOU
GO
ON
AT
PRESENT
I
AM
GOING
INMY
MIND
FROM
POINT
TO
POINT
AS
A
MAD
MAN
AND
NOT
A
SANE
ONE
FOLLOWS
ANIDEA
I
FEEL
LIKE
A
NOVICE
LUMBERING
THROUGH
A
BOG
IN
A
MIST
JUMPINGFROM
ONE
TUSSOCK
TO
ANOTHER
IN
THE
MERE
BLIND
EFFORT
TO
MOVE
ON
WITHOUTKNOWING
WHERE
I
AM
GOING
THAT
IS
GOOD
IMAGE
HE
SAID
WELL
I
SHALL
TELL
YOU
MY
THESIS
ISTHIS
I
WANT
YOU
TO
BELIEVE
TO
BELIEVE
WHAT
TO
BELIEVE
IN
THINGS
THAT
YOU
CANNOT
LET
ME
ILLUSTRATE
I
HEARD
ONCEOF
AN
AMERICAN
WHO
SO
DEFINED
FAITH
THAT
FACULTY
WHICH
ENABLES
US
TOBELIEVE
THINGS
WHICH
WE
KNOW
TO
BE
UNTRUE
FOR
ONE
I
FOLLOW
THAT
MAN
HE
MEANT
THAT
WE
SHALL
HAVE
AN
OPEN
MIND
AND
NOT
LET
A
LITTLE
BIT
OFTRUTH
CHECK
THE
RUSH
OF
A
BIG
TRUTH
LIKE
A
SMALL
ROCK
DOES
A
RAILWAYTRUCK
WE
GET
THE
SMALL
TRUTH
FIRST
GOOD
WE
KEEP
HIM
AND
WE
VALUEHIM
BUT
ALL
THE
SAME
WE
MUST
NOT
LET
HIM
THINK
HIMSELF
ALL
THE
TRUTH
INTHE
UNIVERSE
THEN
YOU
WANT
ME
NOT
TO
LET
SOME
PREVIOUS
CONVICTION
INJURE
THERECEPTIVITY
OF
MY
MIND
WITH
REGARD
TO
SOME
STRANGE
MATTER
DO
I
READYOUR
LESSON
ARIGHT
AH
YOU
ARE
MY
FAVOURITE
PUPIL
STILL
IT
IS
WORTH
TO
TEACH
YOU
NOWTHAT
YOU
ARE
WILLING
TO
UNDERSTAND
YOU
HAVE
TAKEN
THE
FIRST
STEP
TOUNDERSTAND
YOU
THINK
THEN
THAT
THOSE
SO
SMALL
HOLES
IN
THE
CHILDREN
STHROATS
WERE
MADE
BY
THE
SAME
THAT
MADE
THE
HOLE
IN
MISS
LUCY
I
SUPPOSE
SO
HE
STOOD
UP
AND
SAID
SOLEMNLY
THEN
YOU
ARE
WRONG
OH
WOULD
IT
WERE
SO
BUT
ALAS
NO
IT
IS
WORSE
FAR
FAR
WORSE
IN
GOD
S
NAME
PROFESSOR
VAN
HELSING
WHAT
DO
YOU
MEAN
I
CRIED
HE
THREW
HIMSELF
WITH
A
DESPAIRING
GESTURE
INTO
A
CHAIR
AND
PLACED
HISELBOWS
ON
THE
TABLE
COVERING
HIS
FACE
WITH
HIS
HANDS
AS
HE
SPOKE
THEY
WERE
MADE
BY
MISS
LUCY
CHAPTER
XVDR
SEWARD
S
DIARY
CONTINUED
FOR
A
WHILE
SHEER
ANGER
MASTERED
ME
IT
WAS
AS
IF
HE
HAD
DURING
HER
LIFESTRUCK
LUCY
ON
THE
FACE
I
SMOTE
THE
TABLE
HARD
AND
ROSE
UP
AS
I
SAID
TOHIM
DR
VAN
HELSING
ARE
YOU
MAD
HE
RAISED
HIS
HEAD
AND
LOOKED
AT
ME
ANDSOMEHOW
THE
TENDERNESS
OF
HIS
FACE
CALMED
ME
AT
ONCE
WOULD
I
WERE
HESAID
MADNESS
WERE
EASY
TO
BEAR
COMPARED
WITH
TRUTH
LIKE
THIS
OH
MYFRIEND
WHY
THINK
YOU
DID
I
GO
SO
FAR
ROUND
WHY
TAKE
SO
LONG
TO
TELLYOU
SO
SIMPLE
A
THING
WAS
IT
BECAUSE
I
HATE
YOU
AND
HAVE
HATED
YOU
ALLMY
LIFE
WAS
IT
BECAUSE
I
WISHED
TO
GIVE
YOU
PAIN
WAS
IT
THAT
I
WANTED
NOW
SO
LATE
REVENGE
FOR
THAT
TIME
WHEN
YOU
SAVED
MY
LIFE
AND
FROM
AFEARFUL
DEATH
AH
NO
FORGIVE
ME
SAID
I
HE
WENT
ON
MY
FRIEND
IT
WAS
BECAUSE
I
WISHED
TO
BE
GENTLE
IN
THE
BREAKING
TO
YOU
FOR
I
KNOW
YOU
HAVE
LOVED
THAT
SO
SWEET
LADY
BUT
EVEN
YET
I
DO
NOTEXPECT
YOU
TO
BELIEVE
IT
IS
SO
HARD
TO
ACCEPT
AT
ONCE
ANY
ABSTRACTTRUTH
THAT
WE
MAY
DOUBT
SUCH
TO
BE
POSSIBLE
WHEN
WE
HAVE
ALWAYSBELIEVED
THE
NO
OF
IT
IT
IS
MORE
HARD
STILL
TO
ACCEPT
SO
SAD
ACONCRETE
TRUTH
AND
OF
SUCH
A
ONE
AS
MISS
LUCY
TO
NIGHT
I
GO
TO
PROVEIT
DARE
YOU
COME
WITH
ME
THIS
STAGGERED
ME
A
MAN
DOES
NOT
LIKE
TO
PROVE
SUCH
A
TRUTH
BYRONEXCEPTED
FROM
THE
CATEGORY
JEALOUSY
AND
PROVE
THE
VERY
TRUTH
HE
MOST
ABHORRED
HE
SAW
MY
HESITATION
AND
SPOKE
THE
LOGIC
IS
SIMPLE
NO
MADMAN
S
LOGIC
THIS
TIME
JUMPING
FROM
TUSSOCKTO
TUSSOCK
IN
A
MISTY
BOG
IF
IT
BE
NOT
TRUE
THEN
PROOF
WILL
BE
RELIEF
AT
WORST
IT
WILL
NOT
HARM
IF
IT
BE
TRUE
AH
THERE
IS
THE
DREAD
YETVERY
DREAD
SHOULD
HELP
MY
CAUSE
FOR
IN
IT
IS
SOME
NEED
OF
BELIEF
COME
I
TELL
YOU
WHAT
I
PROPOSE
FIRST
THAT
WE
GO
OFF
NOW
AND
SEE
THAT
CHILDIN
THE
HOSPITAL
DR
VINCENT
OF
THE
NORTH
HOSPITAL
WHERE
THE
PAPERSSAY
THE
CHILD
IS
IS
FRIEND
OF
MINE
AND
I
THINK
OF
YOURS
SINCE
YOU
WEREIN
CLASS
AT
AMSTERDAM
HE
WILL
LET
TWO
SCIENTISTS
SEE
HIS
CASE
IF
HEWILL
NOT
LET
TWO
FRIENDS
WE
SHALL
TELL
HIM
NOTHING
BUT
ONLY
THAT
WEWISH
TO
LEARN
AND
THEN
AND
THEN
HE
TOOK
A
KEY
FROM
HIS
POCKET
AND
HELD
IT
UP
AND
THEN
WESPEND
THE
NIGHT
YOU
AND
I
IN
THE
CHURCHYARD
WHERE
LUCY
LIES
THIS
ISTHE
KEY
THAT
LOCK
THE
TOMB
I
HAD
IT
FROM
THE
COFFIN
MAN
TO
GIVE
TOARTHUR
MY
HEART
SANK
WITHIN
ME
FOR
I
FELT
THAT
THERE
WAS
SOME
FEARFULORDEAL
BEFORE
US
I
COULD
DO
NOTHING
HOWEVER
SO
I
PLUCKED
UP
WHATHEART
I
COULD
AND
SAID
THAT
WE
HAD
BETTER
HASTEN
AS
THE
AFTERNOON
WASPASSING
WE
FOUND
THE
CHILD
AWAKE
IT
HAD
HAD
A
SLEEP
AND
TAKEN
SOME
FOOD
ANDALTOGETHER
WAS
GOING
ON
WELL
DR
VINCENT
TOOK
THE
BANDAGE
FROM
ITSTHROAT
AND
SHOWED
US
THE
PUNCTURES
THERE
WAS
NO
MISTAKING
THESIMILARITY
TO
THOSE
WHICH
HAD
BEEN
ON
LUCY
S
THROAT
THEY
WERE
SMALLER
AND
THE
EDGES
LOOKED
FRESHER
THAT
WAS
ALL
WE
ASKED
VINCENT
TO
WHAT
HEATTRIBUTED
THEM
AND
HE
REPLIED
THAT
IT
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
A
BITE
OF
SOMEANIMAL
PERHAPS
A
RAT
BUT
FOR
HIS
OWN
PART
HE
WAS
INCLINED
TO
THINKTHAT
IT
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
BATS
WHICH
ARE
SO
NUMEROUS
ON
THE
NORTHERNHEIGHTS
OF
LONDON
OUT
OF
SO
MANY
HARMLESS
ONES
HE
SAID
THERE
MAYBE
SOME
WILD
SPECIMEN
FROM
THE
SOUTH
OF
A
MORE
MALIGNANT
SPECIES
SOMESAILOR
MAY
HAVE
BROUGHT
ONE
HOME
AND
IT
MANAGED
TO
ESCAPE
OR
EVEN
FROMTHE
ZOOLOGICAL
GARDENS
A
YOUNG
ONE
MAY
HAVE
GOT
LOOSE
OR
ONE
BE
BREDTHERE
FROM
A
VAMPIRE
THESE
THINGS
DO
OCCUR
YOU
KNOW
ONLY
TEN
DAYS
AGOA
WOLF
GOT
OUT
AND
WAS
I
BELIEVE
TRACED
UP
IN
THIS
DIRECTION
FOR
AWEEK
AFTER
THE
CHILDREN
WERE
PLAYING
NOTHING
BUT
RED
RIDING
HOOD
ON
THEHEATH
AND
IN
EVERY
ALLEY
IN
THE
PLACE
UNTIL
THIS
BLOOFER
LADY
SCARECAME
ALONG
SINCE
WHEN
IT
HAS
BEEN
QUITE
A
GALA
TIME
WITH
THEM
EVENTHIS
POOR
LITTLE
MITE
WHEN
HE
WOKE
UP
TO
DAY
ASKED
THE
NURSE
IF
HEMIGHT
GO
AWAY
WHEN
SHE
ASKED
HIM
WHY
HE
WANTED
TO
GO
HE
SAID
HE
WANTEDTO
PLAY
WITH
THE
BLOOFER
LADY
I
HOPE
SAID
VAN
HELSING
THAT
WHEN
YOU
ARE
SENDING
THE
CHILD
HOMEYOU
WILL
CAUTION
ITS
PARENTS
TO
KEEP
STRICT
WATCH
OVER
IT
THESE
FANCIESTO
STRAY
ARE
MOST
DANGEROUS
AND
IF
THE
CHILD
WERE
TO
REMAIN
OUT
ANOTHERNIGHT
IT
WOULD
PROBABLY
BE
FATAL
BUT
IN
ANY
CASE
I
SUPPOSE
YOU
WILLNOT
LET
IT
AWAY
FOR
SOME
DAYS
CERTAINLY
NOT
NOT
FOR
A
WEEK
AT
LEAST
LONGER

MORE
LATE
THAN
I
THOUGHT
COME

THAT
WE
MAY

OFBICYCLISTS
AND
OTHERS
WHO
WERE
GENIALLY

ABOUT
TEN
O

WESTARTED
FROM

IT
WAS

VERY
DARK
AND
THE
SCATTERED

THE

GREATER
WHEN

OUTSIDE

THE
PROFESSOR
HAD
EVIDENTLY
NOTED
THE
ROAD
WE
WERE
TO
GO
FOR
HEWENT
ON
UNHESITATINGLY
BUT
AS
FOR
ME
I
WAS
IN
QUITE
A
MIXUP
AS
TOLOCALITY
AS
WE
WENT
FURTHER
WE
MET
FEWER
AND
FEWER
PEOPLE
TILL
ATLAST
WE
WERE
SOMEWHAT
SURPRISED
WHEN
WE
MET
EVEN
THE
PATROL
OF

SUBURBAN
ROUND
AT

WE
REACHED
THE
WALL
OFTHE
CHURCHYARD
WHICH
WE
CLIMBED
OVER
WITH
SOME
LITTLE
DIFFICULTY
FORIT
WAS
VERY
DARK
AND
THE
WHOLE

SEEMED
SO
STRANGE
TO

WE
FOUNDTHE

THE

TOOK
THE

OPENED
THE
CREAKY

AND
STANDING
BACK
POLITELY
BUT
QUITE
UNCONSCIOUSLY
MOTIONED
ME
TOPRECEDE
HIM
THERE
WAS
A
DELICIOUS
IRONY
IN
THE

IN
THECOURTLINESS
OF
GIVING
PREFERENCE
ON

A
GHASTLY
OCCASION
MYCOMPANION
FOLLOWED
ME
QUICKLY
AND
CAUTIOUSLY
DREW
THE

AFTERCAREFULLY
ASCERTAINING
THAT
THE

WAS
A
FALLING
AND
NOT
A

WHEN

AND

OFF

BENEATH
THE

WAS
ALMOST
TOO
MUCH
FOR

IT
SEEMEDTO
BE
AS

AN

AS
IT
WOULD
HAVE

HIM
HE
ONLY

AND
AGAINFUMBLING
IN

TOOK
OUT
A
TINY
FRET
SAW
STRIKING
THE

THE
LEAD
WITH
A
SWIFT
DOWNWARD
STAB
WHICH
MADE
ME
WINCE
HEMADE
A
SMALL
HOLE
WHICH
WAS
HOWEVER
BIG
ENOUGH
TO
ADMIT
THE
POINT
OFTHE
SAW
I
HAD
EXPECTED
A
RUSH
OF
GAS
FROM
THE
WEEK
OLD
CORPSE
WEDOCTORS
WHO
HAVE
HAD
TO
STUDY
OUR
DANGERS
HAVE
TO
BECOME
ACCUSTOMED
TOSUCH
THINGS
AND
I
DREW
BACK
TOWARDS
THE
DOOR
BUT
THE
PROFESSOR
NEVERSTOPPED
FOR
A
MOMENT
HE
SAWED
DOWN
A
COUPLE
OF
FEET
ALONG
ONE
SIDE
OFTHE
LEAD
COFFIN
AND
THEN
ACROSS
AND
DOWN
THE
OTHER
SIDE
TAKING
THEEDGE
OF
THE
LOOSE
FLANGE
HE
BENT
IT
BACK
TOWARDS
THE
FOOT
OF
THECOFFIN
AND
HOLDING
UP
THE
CANDLE
INTO
THE
APERTURE
MOTIONED
TO
ME
TOLOOK
I
DREW
NEAR
AND
LOOKED
THE
COFFIN
WAS
EMPTY
IT
WAS
CERTAINLY
A
SURPRISE
TO
ME
AND
GAVE
ME
A
CONSIDERABLE
SHOCK
BUTVAN
HELSING
WAS
UNMOVED
HE
WAS
NOW
MORE
SURE
THAN
EVER
OF
HIS
GROUND
AND
SO
EMBOLDENED
TO
PROCEED
IN
HIS
TASK
ARE
YOU
SATISFIED
NOW
FRIENDJOHN
HE
ASKED
I
FELT
ALL
THE
DOGGED
ARGUMENTATIVENESS
OF
MY
NATURE
AWAKE
WITHIN
ME
ASI
ANSWERED
HIM
I
AM
SATISFIED
THAT
LUCY
S
BODY
IS
NOT
IN
THAT
COFFIN
BUT
THAT
ONLYPROVES
ONE
THING
AND
WHAT
IS
THAT
FRIEND
JOHN
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
THERE
THAT
IS
GOOD
LOGIC
HE
SAID
SO
FAR
AS
IT
GOES
BUT
HOW
DO
YOU
HOWCAN
YOU
ACCOUNT
FOR
IT
NOT
BEING
THERE
PERHAPS
A
BODY
SNATCHER
I
SUGGESTED
SOME
OF
THE
UNDERTAKER
S
PEOPLEMAY
HAVE
STOLEN
IT
I
FELT
THAT
I
WAS
SPEAKING
FOLLY
AND
YET
IT
WASTHE
ONLY
REAL
CAUSE
WHICH
I
COULD
SUGGEST
THE
PROFESSOR
SIGHED
AHWELL
HE
SAID
WE
MUST
HAVE
MORE
PROOF
COME
WITH
ME
HE
PUT
ON
THE
COFFIN
LID
AGAIN
GATHERED
UP
ALL
HIS
THINGS
AND
PLACEDTHEM
IN
THE
BAG
BLEW
OUT
THE
LIGHT
AND
PLACED
THE
CANDLE
ALSO
IN
THEBAG
WE
OPENED
THE
DOOR
AND
WENT
OUT
BEHIND
US
HE
CLOSED
THE
DOOR
ANDLOCKED
IT
HE
HANDED
ME
THE
KEY
SAYING
WILL
YOU
KEEP
IT
YOU
HADBETTER
BE
ASSURED
I
LAUGHED
IT
WAS
NOT
A
VERY
CHEERFUL
LAUGH
I
AMBOUND
TO
SAY
AS
I
MOTIONED
HIM
TO
KEEP
IT
A
KEY
IS
NOTHING
I
SAID
THERE
MAY
BE
DUPLICATES
AND
ANYHOW
IT
IS
NOT
DIFFICULT
TO
PICK
A
LOCKOF
THAT
KIND
HE
SAID
NOTHING
BUT
PUT
THE
KEY
IN
HIS
POCKET
THEN
HETOLD
ME
TO
WATCH
AT
ONE
SIDE
OF
THE
CHURCHYARD
WHILST
HE
WOULD
WATCH
ATTHE
OTHER
I
TOOK
UP
MY
PLACE
BEHIND
A
YEW
TREE
AND
I
SAW
HIS
DARKFIGURE
MOVE
UNTIL
THE
INTERVENING
HEADSTONES
AND
TREES
HID
IT
FROM
MYSIGHT
IT
WAS
A
LONELY
VIGIL
JUST
AFTER
I
HAD
TAKEN
MY
PLACE
I
HEARD
A
DISTANTCLOCK
STRIKE
TWELVE
AND
IN
TIME
CAME
ONE
AND
TWO
I
WAS
CHILLED
ANDUNNERVED
AND
ANGRY
WITH
THE
PROFESSOR
FOR
TAKING
ME
ON
SUCH
AN
ERRANDAND
WITH
MYSELF
FOR
COMING
I
WAS
TOO
COLD
AND
TOO
SLEEPY
TO
BE
KEENLYOBSERVANT
AND
NOT
SLEEPY
ENOUGH
TO
BETRAY
MY
TRUST
SO
ALTOGETHER
I
HADA
DREARY
MISERABLE
TIME
SUDDENLY
AS
I
TURNED
ROUND
I
THOUGHT
I
SAW
SOMETHING
LIKE
A
WHITESTREAK
MOVING
BETWEEN
TWO
DARK
YEW
TREES
AT
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
CHURCHYARDFARTHEST
FROM
THE
TOMB
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
A
DARK
MASS
MOVED
FROM
THEPROFESSOR
S
SIDE
OF
THE
GROUND
AND
HURRIEDLY
WENT
TOWARDS
IT
THEN
ITOO
MOVED
BUT
I
HAD
TO
GO
ROUND
HEADSTONES
AND
RAILED
OFF
TOMBS
AND
ISTUMBLED
OVER
GRAVES
THE
SKY
WAS
OVERCAST
AND
SOMEWHERE
FAR
OFF
ANEARLY
COCK
CREW
A
LITTLE
WAY
OFF
BEYOND
A
LINE
OF
SCATTEREDJUNIPER
TREES
WHICH
MARKED
THE
PATHWAY
TO
THE
CHURCH
A
WHITE
DIMFIGURE
FLITTED
IN
THE
DIRECTION
OF
THE
TOMB
THE
TOMB
ITSELF
WAS
HIDDENBY
TREES
AND
I
COULD
NOT
SEE
WHERE
THE
FIGURE
DISAPPEARED
I
HEARD
THERUSTLE
OF
ACTUAL
MOVEMENT
WHERE
I
HAD
FIRST
SEEN
THE
WHITE
FIGURE
ANDCOMING
OVER
FOUND
THE
PROFESSOR
HOLDING
IN
HIS
ARMS
A
TINY
CHILD
WHENHE
SAW
ME
HE
HELD
IT
OUT
TO
ME
AND
SAID
ARE
YOU
SATISFIED
NOW
NO
I
SAID
IN
A
WAY
THAT
I
FELT
WAS
AGGRESSIVE
DO
YOU
NOT
SEE
THE
CHILD
YES
IT
IS
A
CHILD
BUT
WHO
BROUGHT
IT
HERE
AND
IS
IT
WOUNDED
IASKED
WE
SHALL
SEE
SAID
THE
PROFESSOR
AND
WITH
ONE
IMPULSE
WE
TOOK
OUR
WAYOUT
OF
THE
CHURCHYARD
HE
CARRYING
THE
SLEEPING
CHILD
WHEN
WE
HAD
GOT
SOME
LITTLE
DISTANCE
AWAY
WE
WENT
INTO
A
CLUMP
OFTREES
AND
STRUCK
A
MATCH
AND
LOOKED
AT
THE
CHILD
S
THROAT
IT
WASWITHOUT
A
SCRATCH
OR
SCAR
OF
ANY
KIND
WAS
I
RIGHT
I
ASKED
TRIUMPHANTLY
WE
WERE
JUST
IN
TIME
SAID
THE
PROFESSOR
THANKFULLY
WE
HAD
NOW
TO
DECIDE
WHAT
WE
WERE
TO
DO
WITH
THE
CHILD
AND
SO
CONSULTEDABOUT
IT
IF
WE
WERE
TO
TAKE
IT
TO
A
POLICE
STATION
WE
SHOULD
HAVE
TOGIVE
SOME
ACCOUNT
OF
OUR
MOVEMENTS
DURING
THE
NIGHT
AT
LEAST
WE
SHOULDHAVE
HAD
TO
MAKE
SOME
STATEMENT
AS
TO
HOW
WE
HAD
COME
TO
FIND
THE
CHILD
SO
FINALLY
WE
DECIDED
THAT
WE
WOULD
TAKE
IT
TO
THE
HEATH
AND
WHEN
WEHEARD
A
POLICEMAN
COMING
WOULD
LEAVE
IT
WHERE
HE
COULD
NOT
FAIL
TO
FINDIT
WE
WOULD
THEN
SEEK
OUR
WAY
HOME
AS
QUICKLY
AS
WE
COULD
ALL
FELL
OUTWELL
AT
THE
EDGE
OF
HAMPSTEAD
HEATH
WE
HEARD
A
POLICEMAN
S
HEAVYTRAMP
AND
LAYING
THE
CHILD
ON
THE
PATHWAY
WE
WAITED
AND
WATCHED
UNTILHE
SAW
IT
AS
HE
FLASHED
HIS
LANTERN
TO
AND
FRO
WE
HEARD
HIS
EXCLAMATIONOF
ASTONISHMENT
AND
THEN
WE
WENT
AWAY
SILENTLY
BY
GOOD
CHANCE
WE
GOT
ACAB
NEAR
THE
SPANIARDS
AND
DROVE
TO
TOWN
I
CANNOT
SLEEP
SO
I
MAKE
THIS
ENTRY
BUT
I
MUST
TRY
TO
GET
A
FEW
HOURS
SLEEP
AS
VAN
HELSING
IS
TO
CALL
FOR
ME
AT
NOON
HE
INSISTS
THAT
I
SHALLGO
WITH
HIM
ON
ANOTHER
EXPEDITION
SEPTEMBER
IT
WAS
TWO
O
CLOCK
BEFORE
WE
FOUND
A
SUITABLEOPPORTUNITY
FOR
OUR
ATTEMPT
THE
FUNERAL
HELD
AT
NOON
WAS
ALL
COMPLETED
AND
THE
LAST
STRAGGLERS
OF
THE
MOURNERS
HAD
TAKEN
THEMSELVES
LAZILYAWAY
WHEN
LOOKING
CAREFULLY
FROM
BEHIND
A
CLUMP
OF
ALDER
TREES
WE
SAWTHE
SEXTON
LOCK
THE
GATE
AFTER
HIM
WE
KNEW
THEN
THAT
WE
WERE
SAFE
TILLMORNING
DID
WE
DESIRE
IT
BUT
THE
PROFESSOR
TOLD
ME
THAT
WE
SHOULD
NOTWANT
MORE
THAN
AN
HOUR
AT
MOST
AGAIN
I
FELT
THAT
HORRID
SENSE
OF
THEREALITY
OF
THINGS
IN
WHICH
ANY
EFFORT
OF
IMAGINATION
SEEMED
OUT
OFPLACE
AND
I
REALISED
DISTINCTLY
THE
PERILS
OF
THE
LAW
WHICH
WE
WEREINCURRING
IN
OUR
UNHALLOWED
WORK
BESIDES
I
FELT
IT
WAS
ALL
SO
USELESS
OUTRAGEOUS
AS
IT
WAS
TO
OPEN
A
LEADEN
COFFIN
TO
SEE
IF
A
WOMAN
DEADNEARLY
A
WEEK
WERE
REALLY
DEAD
IT
NOW
SEEMED
THE
HEIGHT
OF
FOLLY
TOOPEN
THE
TOMB
AGAIN
WHEN
WE
KNEW
FROM
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
OUR
OWNEYESIGHT
THAT
THE
COFFIN
WAS
EMPTY
I
SHRUGGED
MY
SHOULDERS
HOWEVER
AND
RESTED
SILENT
FOR
VAN
HELSING
HAD
A
WAY
OF
GOING
ON
HIS
OWN
ROAD
NO
MATTER
WHO
REMONSTRATED
HE
TOOK
THE
KEY
OPENED
THE
VAULT
AND
AGAINCOURTEOUSLY
MOTIONED
ME
TO
PRECEDE
THE
PLACE
WAS
NOT
SO
GRUESOME
ASLAST
NIGHT
BUT
OH
HOW
UNUTTERABLY
MEAN
LOOKING
WHEN
THE
SUNSHINESTREAMED
IN
VAN
HELSING
WALKED
OVER
TO
LUCY
S
COFFIN
AND
I
FOLLOWED
HE
BENT
OVER
AND
AGAIN
FORCED
BACK
THE
LEADEN
FLANGE
AND
THEN
A
SHOCKOF
SURPRISE
AND
DISMAY
SHOT
THROUGH
ME
THERE
LAY
LUCY
SEEMINGLY
JUST
AS
WE
HAD
SEEN
HER
THE
NIGHT
BEFORE
HERFUNERAL
SHE
WAS
IF
POSSIBLE
MORE
RADIANTLY
BEAUTIFUL
THAN
EVER
AND
ICOULD
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
SHE
WAS
DEAD
THE
LIPS
WERE
RED
NAY
REDDER
THANBEFORE
AND
ON
THE
CHEEKS
WAS
A
DELICATE
BLOOM
IS
THIS
A
JUGGLE
I
SAID
TO
HIM
ARE
YOU
CONVINCED
NOW
SAID
THE
PROFESSOR
IN
RESPONSE
AND
AS
HE
SPOKEHE
PUT
OVER
HIS
HAND
AND
IN
A
WAY
THAT
MADE
ME
SHUDDER
PULLED
BACK
THEDEAD
LIPS
AND
SHOWED
THE
WHITE
TEETH
SEE
HE
WENT
ON
SEE
THEY
ARE
EVEN
SHARPER
THAN
BEFORE
WITH
THISAND
THIS
AND
HE
TOUCHED
ONE
OF
THE
CANINE
TEETH
AND
THAT
BELOWIT
THE
LITTLE
CHILDREN
CAN
BE
BITTEN
ARE
YOU
OF
BELIEF
NOW
FRIENDJOHN
ONCE
MORE
ARGUMENTATIVE
HOSTILITY
WOKE
WITHIN
ME
I
COULD
NOTACCEPT
SUCH
AN
OVERWHELMING
IDEA
AS
HE
SUGGESTED
SO
WITH
AN
ATTEMPT
TOARGUE
OF
WHICH
I
WAS
EVEN
AT
THE
MOMENT
ASHAMED
I
SAID
SHE
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
PLACED
HERE
SINCE
LAST
NIGHT
INDEED
THAT
IS
SO
AND
BY
WHOM
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
SOME
ONE
HAS
DONE
IT
AND
YET
SHE
HAS
BEEN
DEAD
ONE
WEEK
MOST
PEOPLES
IN
THAT
TIME
WOULD
NOTLOOK
SO
I
HAD
NO
ANSWER
FOR
THIS
SO
WAS
SILENT
VAN
HELSING
DID
NOTSEEM
TO
NOTICE
MY
SILENCE
AT
ANY
RATE
HE
SHOWED
NEITHER
CHAGRIN
NORTRIUMPH
HE
WAS
LOOKING
INTENTLY
AT
THE
FACE
OF
THE
DEAD
WOMAN
RAISINGTHE
EYELIDS
AND
LOOKING
AT
THE
EYES
AND
ONCE
MORE
OPENING
THE
LIPS
ANDEXAMINING
THE
TEETH
THEN
HE
TURNED
TO
ME
AND
SAID
HERE
THERE
IS
ONE
THING
WHICH
IS
DIFFERENT
FROM
ALL
RECORDED
HERE
ISSOME
DUAL
LIFE
THAT
IS
NOT
AS
THE
COMMON
SHE
WAS
BITTEN
BY
THE
VAMPIREWHEN
SHE
WAS
IN
A
TRANCE
SLEEP
WALKING
OH
YOU
START
YOU
DO
NOT
KNOWTHAT
FRIEND
JOHN
BUT
YOU
SHALL
KNOW
IT
ALL
LATER
AND
IN
TRANCE
COULDHE
BEST
COME
TO
TAKE
MORE
BLOOD
IN
TRANCE
SHE
DIED
AND
IN
TRANCE
SHEIS
UN
DEAD
TOO
SO
IT
IS
THAT
SHE
DIFFER
FROM
ALL
OTHER
USUALLY
WHENTHE
UN
DEAD
SLEEP
AT
HOME
AS
HE
SPOKE
HE
MADE
A
COMPREHENSIVE
SWEEP
OFHIS
ARM
TO
DESIGNATE
WHAT
TO
A
VAMPIRE
WAS
HOME
THEIR
FACE
SHOW
WHATTHEY
ARE
BUT
THIS
SO
SWEET
THAT
WAS
WHEN
SHE
NOT
UN
DEAD
SHE
GO
BACK
TOTHE
NOTHINGS
OF
THE
COMMON
DEAD
THERE
IS
NO
MALIGN
THERE
SEE
AND
SOIT
MAKE
HARD
THAT
I
MUST
KILL
HER
IN
HER
SLEEP
THIS
TURNED
MY
BLOODCOLD
AND
IT
BEGAN
TO
DAWN
UPON
ME
THAT
I
WAS
ACCEPTING
VAN
HELSING
STHEORIES
BUT
IF
SHE
WERE
REALLY
DEAD
WHAT
WAS
THERE
OF
TERROR
IN
THEIDEA
OF
KILLING
HER
HE
LOOKED
UP
AT
ME
AND
EVIDENTLY
SAW
THE
CHANGE
INMY
FACE
FOR
HE
SAID
ALMOST
JOYOUSLY
AH
YOU
BELIEVE
NOW
I
ANSWERED
DO
NOT
PRESS
ME
TOO
HARD
ALL
AT
ONCE
I
AM
WILLING
TOACCEPT
HOW
WILL
YOU
DO
THIS
BLOODY
WORK
I
SHALL
CUT
OFF
HER
HEAD
AND
FILL
HER
MOUTH
WITH
GARLIC
AND
I
SHALLDRIVE
A
STAKE
THROUGH
HER
BODY
IT
MADE
ME
SHUDDER
TO
THINK
OF
SOMUTILATING
THE
BODY
OF
THE
WOMAN
WHOM
I
HAD
LOVED
AND
YET
THE
FEELINGWAS
NOT
SO
STRONG
AS
I
HAD
EXPECTED
I
WAS
IN
FACT
BEGINNING
TOSHUDDER
AT
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THIS
BEING
THIS
UN
DEAD
AS
VAN
HELSINGCALLED
IT
AND
TO
LOATHE
IT
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
THAT
LOVE
IS
ALL
SUBJECTIVE
OR
ALL
OBJECTIVE
I
WAITED
A
CONSIDERABLE
TIME
FOR
VAN
HELSING
TO
BEGIN
BUT
HE
STOOD
ASIF
WRAPPED
IN
THOUGHT
PRESENTLY
HE
CLOSED
THE
CATCH
OF
HIS
BAG
WITH
ASNAP
AND
SAID
I
HAVE
BEEN
THINKING
AND
HAVE
MADE
UP
MY
MIND
AS
TO
WHAT
IS
BEST
IF
IDID
SIMPLY
FOLLOW
MY
INCLINING
I
WOULD
DO
NOW
AT
THIS
MOMENT
WHAT
ISTO
BE
DONE
BUT
THERE
ARE
OTHER
THINGS
TO
FOLLOW
AND
THINGS
THAT
ARETHOUSAND
TIMES
MORE
DIFFICULT
IN
THAT
THEM
WE
DO
NOT
KNOW
THIS
ISSIMPLE
SHE
HAVE
YET
NO
LIFE
TAKEN
THOUGH
THAT
IS
OF
TIME
AND
TO
ACTNOW
WOULD
BE
TO
TAKE
DANGER
FROM
HER
FOR
EVER
BUT
THEN
WE
MAY
HAVE
TOWANT
ARTHUR
AND
HOW
SHALL
WE
TELL
HIM
OF
THIS
IF
YOU

MOST
SCEPTICAL
OF

PRESENCE
OF
SUCH
EARNEST

WE
TOOK
THE
PLACESASSIGNED

AWOEFUL
PRESAGE
THROUGH

STOPPED
AND
AT
THE

A
DARK
HAIRED

SURPRISE
YES
HE
ANSWERED
I
KEEP
IT
IN
THIS
AS
HE
SPOKE
HE
LAID
HIS
HAND
ONTHE
PHONOGRAPH
I
FELT
QUITE
EXCITED
OVER
IT
AND
BLURTED
OUT
WHY
THIS
BEATS
EVEN
SHORTHAND
MAY
I
HEAR
IT
SAY
SOMETHING
CERTAINLY
HE
REPLIED
WITH
ALACRITY
AND
STOOD
UP
TO
PUT
IT
IN
TRAINFOR
SPEAKING
THEN
HE
PAUSED
AND
A
TROUBLED
LOOK
OVERSPREAD
HIS
FACE
THE
FACT
IS
HE
BEGAN
AWKWARDLY
I
ONLY
KEEP
MY
DIARY
IN
IT
AND
ASIT
IS
ENTIRELY
ALMOST
ENTIRELY
ABOUT
MY
CASES

TRIED
TO

VERY
GRATEFUL

VERY
VERYDEAR
TO

WITH
A
HORRORSTRUCK
LOOK
IN
HIS

YOU
OF
HER

FOR
THE
WIDE
WORLD
WHY
NOT
I
ASKED
FOR
SOME
GRAVE
TERRIBLE
FEELING

COMING
OVER
ME
AGAIN
HE
PAUSED
AND
I
COULD
SEE
THAT
HE
WAS
TRYING
TO
INVENT
AN
EXCUSE
AT
LENGTH
HE
STAMMERED
OUT
YOU
SEE
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
HOW
TO
PICK
OUT
ANY
PARTICULAR
PART
OF
THEDIARY
EVEN
WHILE
HE
WAS
SPEAKING
AN
IDEA
DAWNED
UPON
HIM
AND
HE
SAIDWITH
UNCONSCIOUS
SIMPLICITY
IN
A
DIFFERENT
VOICE
AND
WITH
THE
NAIVETEOF
A
CHILD
THAT
S
QUITE
TRUE
UPON
MY
HONOUR
HONEST
INDIAN
I
COULDNOT
BUT
SMILE
AT
WHICH
HE
GRIMACED
I
GAVE
MYSELF
AWAY
THAT
TIME
HESAID
BUT
DO
YOU
KNOW
THAT
ALTHOUGH
I
HAVE
KEPT
THE
DIARY
FOR
MONTHSPAST
IT
NEVER
ONCE
STRUCK
ME
HOW
I
WAS
GOING
TO
FIND
ANY
PARTICULARPART
OF
IT
IN
CASE
I
WANTED
TO
LOOK
IT
UP
BY
THIS
TIME
MY
MIND
WASMADE
UP
THAT
THE
DIARY
OF
A
DOCTOR
WHO
ATTENDED
LUCY
MIGHT
HAVESOMETHING
TO
ADD
TO
THE
SUM
OF
OUR
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THAT
TERRIBLE
BEING
ANDI
SAID
BOLDLY
THEN
DR
SEWARD
YOU
HAD
BETTER
LET
ME
COPY
IT
OUT
FOR
YOU
ON
MYTYPEWRITER
HE
GREW
TO
A
POSITIVELY
DEATHLY
PALLOR
AS
HE
SAID
NO

FOR
ALL
THE
WORLD
I
WOULDN
T
LET
YOU
KNOW
THAT
TERRIBLESTORY
THEN
IT
WAS
TERRIBLE
MY
INTUITION
WAS
RIGHT
FOR
A
MOMENT
I
THOUGHT
AND
AS
MY
EYES
RANGED
THE
ROOM
UNCONSCIOUSLY
LOOKING
FOR
SOMETHING
ORSOME
OPPORTUNITY
TO
AID
ME
THEY
LIT
ON
A
GREAT
BATCH
OF
TYPEWRITING
ONTHE
TABLE
HIS
EYES
CAUGHT
THE
LOOK
IN
MINE
AND
WITHOUT
HIS
THINKING
FOLLOWED
THEIR
DIRECTION
AS
THEY
SAW
THE
PARCEL
HE
REALISED
MY
MEANING

DO
NOT
KNOW
ME

SAID
WHEN

CERTAINLY
A
MAN
OF
NOBLE
NATURE
POOR

STOOD
UP
AND
OPENED
A
LARGE
DRAWER

NUMBER
OF
HOLLOW
CYLINDERS
OF
METAL
COVERED
WITH
DARK
WAX

CARRIED
THE
PHONOGRAPH
HIMSELF
UPTO
MY
SITTING
ROOM
AND
ADJUSTED
IT
FOR
ME
NOW
I
SHALL
LEARN
SOMETHINGPLEASANT
I
AM
SURE
FOR
IT
WILL
TELL
ME
THE
OTHER
SIDE
OF
A
TRUE
LOVEEPISODE
OF
WHICH
I
KNOW
ONE
SIDE
ALREADY
DR
SEWARD
S
DIARY
SEPTEMBER
I
WAS
SO
ABSORBED
IN
THAT
WONDERFUL
DIARY
OF
JONATHANHARKER
AND
THAT
OTHER
OF
HIS
WIFE
THAT
I
LET
THE
TIME
RUN
ON
WITHOUTTHINKING
MRS
HARKER
WAS
NOT
DOWN
WHEN
THE
MAID
CAME
TO
ANNOUNCEDINNER
SO
I
SAID
SHE
IS
POSSIBLY
TIRED
LET
DINNER
WAIT
AN
HOUR
ANDI
WENT
ON
WITH
MY
WORK
I
HAD
JUST
FINISHED
MRS
HARKER
S
DIARY
WHENSHE
CAME
IN
SHE
LOOKED
SWEETLY
PRETTY
BUT
VERY
SAD
AND
HER
EYES
WEREFLUSHED
WITH
CRYING
THIS
SOMEHOW
MOVED
ME
MUCH
OF
LATE
I
HAVE
HADCAUSE
FOR
TEARS
GOD
KNOWS
BUT
THE
RELIEF
OF
THEM
WAS
DENIED
ME
ANDNOW
THE
SIGHT
OF
THOSE
SWEET
EYES
BRIGHTENED
WITH
RECENT
TEARS
WENTSTRAIGHT
TO
MY
HEART
SO
I
SAID
AS
GENTLY
AS
I
COULD
I
GREATLY
FEAR
I
HAVE
DISTRESSED
YOU
OH
NO
NOT
DISTRESSED
ME
SHE
REPLIED
BUT
I
HAVE
BEEN
MORE
TOUCHEDTHAN
I
CAN
SAY
BY
YOUR
GRIEF
THAT
IS
A
WONDERFUL
MACHINE
BUT
IT
ISCRUELLY
TRUE
IT
TOLD
ME
IN
ITS
VERY
TONES
THE
ANGUISH
OF
YOUR
HEART
IT
WAS
LIKE
A
SOUL
CRYING
OUT
TO
ALMIGHTY
GOD
NO
ONE
MUST
HEAR
THEMSPOKEN
EVER
AGAIN
SEE
I
HAVE
TRIED
TO
BE
USEFUL
I
HAVE
COPIED
OUT
THEWORDS
ON
MY
TYPEWRITER
AND
NONE
OTHER
NEED
NOW
HEAR
YOUR
HEART
BEAT
ASI
DID
NO
ONE
NEED
EVER
KNOW
SHALL
EVER
KNOW
I
SAID
IN
A
LOW
VOICE
SHELAID
HER
HAND
ON
MINE
AND
SAID
VERY
GRAVELY
AH
BUT
THEY
MUST
MUST
BUT
WHY
I
ASKED
BECAUSE
IT
IS
A
PART
OF
THE
TERRIBLE
STORY
A
PART
OF
POOR
DEAR
LUCY
SDEATH
AND
ALL
THAT
LED
TO
IT
BECAUSE
IN
THE
STRUGGLE
WHICH
WE
HAVEBEFORE
US
TO
RID
THE
EARTH
OF
THIS
TERRIBLE
MONSTER
WE
MUST
HAVE
ALLTHE
KNOWLEDGE
AND
ALL
THE
HELP
WHICH
WE
CAN
GET
I
THINK
THAT
THECYLINDERS
WHICH
YOU
GAVE
ME
CONTAINED
MORE
THAN
YOU
INTENDED
ME
TO
KNOW
BUT
I
CAN
SEE
THAT
THERE
ARE
IN
YOUR
RECORD
MANY
LIGHTS
TO
THIS
DARKMYSTERY
YOU
WILL
LET
ME
HELP
WILL
YOU
NOT
I
KNOW
ALL
UP
TO
A
CERTAINPOINT
AND
I
SEE
ALREADY
THOUGH
YOUR
DIARY
ONLY
TOOK
ME
TO
SEPTEMBER
HOW
POOR
LUCY
WAS
BESET
AND
HOW
HER
TERRIBLE
DOOM
WAS
BEING
WROUGHTOUT
JONATHAN
AND
I
HAVE
BEEN
WORKING
DAY
AND
NIGHT
SINCE

MORROW
TO

US
WE
NEED
HAVE
NO
SECRETS
AMONGST
US
WORKING
TOGETHER
AND
WITH
ABSOLUTE
TRUST
WE
CAN
SURELY
BE
STRONGER
THANIF
SOME
OF
US
WERE
IN
THE
DARK
SHE
LOOKED
AT
ME
SO
APPEALINGLY
AND
ATTHE
SAME
TIME
MANIFESTED
SUCH
COURAGE
AND
RESOLUTION
IN
HER
BEARING
THAT
I
GAVE
IN
AT
ONCE
TO
HER
WISHES
YOU
SHALL
I
SAID
DO
AS
YOULIKE
IN
THE
MATTER
GOD
FORGIVE
ME
IF
I
DO
WRONG
THERE
ARE
TERRIBLETHINGS
YET
TO
LEARN
OF
BUT
IF
YOU
HAVE
SO
FAR
TRAVELLED
ON
THE
ROAD
TOPOOR
LUCY
S
DEATH
YOU
WILL
NOT
BE
CONTENT
I
KNOW
TO
REMAIN
IN
THEDARK
NAY
THE
END
THE
VERY
END
MAY
GIVE
YOU
A
GLEAM
OF
PEACE
COME
THERE
IS

ANOTHER
STRONG
FOR
WHAT
IS
BEFORE

WE
HAVE
A
CRUEL
AND
DREADFUL
TASK
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
EATEN
YOU
SHALL
LEARNTHE
REST
AND
I
SHALL
ANSWER
ANY
QUESTIONS
YOU
ASK
IF
THERE
BE
ANYTHINGWHICH
YOU
DO
NOT
UNDERSTAND
THOUGH
IT
WAS
APPARENT
TO
US
WHO
WEREPRESENT
MINA
HARKER
S
JOURNAL
SEPTEMBER
AFTER
DINNER
I
CAME
WITH
DR
SEWARD
TO
HIS
STUDY
HEBROUGHT
BACK
THE
PHONOGRAPH
FROM
MY
ROOM
AND
I
TOOK
MY
TYPEWRITER
HEPLACED
ME
IN
A
COMFORTABLE
CHAIR
AND
ARRANGED
THE
PHONOGRAPH
SO
THAT
ICOULD
TOUCH
IT
WITHOUT
GETTING
UP
AND
SHOWED
ME
HOW
TO
STOP
IT
IN
CASEI
SHOULD
WANT
TO
PAUSE
THEN
HE
VERY
THOUGHTFULLY
TOOK
A
CHAIR
WITH
HISBACK
TO
ME
SO
THAT
I
MIGHT
BE
AS
FREE
AS
POSSIBLE
AND
BEGAN
TO
READ
IPUT
THE
FORKED
METAL
TO
MY
EARS
AND
LISTENED
WHEN
THE
TERRIBLE
STORY
OF
LUCY
S
DEATH
AND
AND
ALL
THAT
FOLLOWED
WASDONE
I
LAY
BACK
IN
MY
CHAIR
POWERLESS
FORTUNATELY
I
AM
NOT
OF
AFAINTING
DISPOSITION
WHEN
DR
SEWARD
SAW
ME
HE
JUMPED
UP
WITH
AHORRIFIED
EXCLAMATION
AND
HURRIEDLY
TAKING
A
CASE
BOTTLE
FROM
ACUPBOARD
GAVE
ME
SOME
BRANDY
WHICH
IN
A
FEW
MINUTES
SOMEWHAT
RESTOREDME
MY
BRAIN
WAS
ALL
IN
A
WHIRL
AND
ONLY
THAT
THERE
CAME
THROUGH
ALLTHE
MULTITUDE
OF
HORRORS
THE
HOLY
RAY
OF
LIGHT
THAT
MY
DEAR
DEAR
LUCYWAS
AT
LAST
AT
PEACE
I
DO
NOT
THINK
I
COULD
HAVE
BORNE
IT
WITHOUTMAKING
A
SCENE
IT
IS
ALL
SO
WILD
AND
MYSTERIOUS
AND
STRANGE
THAT
IF
IHAD
NOT
KNOWN
JONATHAN
S
EXPERIENCE
IN
TRANSYLVANIA
I
COULD
NOT
HAVEBELIEVED
AS
IT
WAS
I
DIDN
T
KNOW
WHAT
TO
BELIEVE
AND
SO
GOT
OUT
OF
MYDIFFICULTY
BY
ATTENDING
TO
SOMETHING
ELSE
I
TOOK
THE
COVER
OFF
MYTYPEWRITER
AND
SAID
TO
DR
SEWARD
LET
ME
WRITE
THIS
ALL
OUT
NOW
WE
MUST
BE
READY
FOR
DR
VAN
HELSINGWHEN
HE
COMES
I
HAVE
SENT
A
TELEGRAM
TO
JONATHAN
TO
COME
ON
HERE
WHENHE
ARRIVES
IN
LONDON
FROM
WHITBY
IN
THIS
MATTER
DATES
ARE
EVERYTHING
AND
I
THINK
THAT
IF
WE
GET
ALL
OUR
MATERIAL
READY
AND
HAVE
EVERY
ITEMPUT
IN
CHRONOLOGICAL
ORDER
WE
SHALL
HAVE
DONE
MUCH
YOU
TELL
ME
THATLORD
GODALMING
AND
MR
MORRIS
ARE
COMING
TOO
LET
US
BE
ABLE
TO
TELL
HIMWHEN
THEY
COME
HE
ACCORDINGLY
SET
THE
PHONOGRAPH
AT
A
SLOW
PACE
AND
IBEGAN
TO
TYPEWRITE
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
SEVENTH
CYLINDER
I
USEDMANIFOLD
AND
SO
TOOK
THREE
COPIES
OF
THE
DIARY
JUST
AS
I
HAD
DONE
WITHALL
THE
REST
IT
WAS
LATE
WHEN
I
GOT
THROUGH
BUT
DR
SEWARD
WENT
ABOUTHIS
WORK
OF
GOING
HIS
ROUND
OF
THE
PATIENTS
WHEN
HE
HAD
FINISHED
HECAME
BACK
AND
SAT
NEAR
ME
READING
SO
THAT
I
DID
NOT
FEEL
TOO
LONELYWHILST
I
WORKED
HOW
GOOD
AND
THOUGHTFUL
HE
IS
THE
WORLD
SEEMS
FULL
OFGOOD
MEN
EVEN
IF
THERE
ARE
MONSTERS
IN
IT
BEFORE
I
LEFT
HIM
IREMEMBERED
WHAT
JONATHAN
PUT
IN
HIS
DIARY
OF
THE
PROFESSOR
SPERTURBATION
AT
READING
SOMETHING
IN
AN
EVENING
PAPER
AT
THE
STATION
ATEXETER
SO
SEEING
THAT
DR
SEWARD
KEEPS
HIS
NEWSPAPERS
I
BORROWED
THEFILES
OF
THE
WESTMINSTER
GAZETTE
AND
THE
PALL
MALL
GAZETTE
AND
TOOKTHEM
TO
MY
ROOM
I
REMEMBER
HOW
MUCH
THE
DAILYGRAPH
AND
THE
WHITBYGAZETTE
OF
WHICH
I
HAD
MADE
CUTTINGS
HELPED
US
TO
UNDERSTAND
THETERRIBLE
EVENTS
AT
WHITBY
WHEN
COUNT
DRACULA
LANDED
SO
I
SHALL
LOOKTHROUGH
THE
EVENING
PAPERS
SINCE
THEN
AND
PERHAPS
I
SHALL
GET
SOME
NEWLIGHT
I
AM
NOT
SLEEPY
AND
THE
WORK
WILL
HELP
TO
KEEP
ME
QUIET
DR
SEWARD
S
DIARY
SEPTEMBER
MR
HARKER
ARRIVED
AT
NINE
O
CLOCK
HE
HAD
GOT
HISWIFE
S
WIRE
JUST
BEFORE
STARTING
HE
IS
UNCOMMONLY
CLEVER
IF
ONE
CANJUDGE
FROM
HIS
FACE
AND
FULL
OF
ENERGY
IF
THIS
JOURNAL
BE
TRUE
ANDJUDGING
BY
ONE
S
OWN
WONDERFUL
EXPERIENCES
IT
MUST
BE
HE
IS
ALSO
A
MANOF
GREAT
NERVE
THAT
GOING
DOWN
TO
THE
VAULT
A
SECOND
TIME
WAS
AREMARKABLE
PIECE
OF
DARING
AFTER
READING
HIS
ACCOUNT
OF
IT
I
WASPREPARED
TO
MEET
A
GOOD
SPECIMEN
OF
MANHOOD
BUT
HARDLY
THE
QUIET
BUSINESS
LIKE
GENTLEMAN
WHO
CAME
HERE
TO
DAY
LATER
AFTER
LUNCH
HARKER
AND
HIS
WIFE
WENT
BACK
TO
THEIR
OWN
ROOM
AND
AS
I
PASSED
A
WHILE
AGO
I
HEARD
THE
CLICK
OF
THE
TYPEWRITER
THEYARE
HARD
AT
IT
MRS
HARKER
SAYS
THAT
THEY
ARE
KNITTING
TOGETHER
INCHRONOLOGICAL
ORDER
EVERY
SCRAP
OF
EVIDENCE
THEY
HAVE
HARKER
HAS
GOTTHE
LETTERS
BETWEEN
THE
CONSIGNEE
OF
THE
BOXES
AT
WHITBY
AND
THECARRIERS
IN
LONDON
WHO
TOOK
CHARGE
OF
THEM
HE
IS
NOW
READING
HIS
WIFE
STYPESCRIPT
OF
MY
DIARY
I
WONDER
WHAT
THEY
MAKE
OUT
OF
IT
HERE
ITIS
STRANGE
THAT
IT
NEVER
STRUCK
ME
THAT
THE
VERY
NEXT
HOUSE
MIGHT
BE
THE
COUNT
S
HIDING
PLACE
GOODNESS
KNOWS
THAT
WE
HAD
ENOUGH
CLUES
FROM
THE
CONDUCT
OF
THE
PATIENT
RENFIELD
THE
BUNDLE
OF
LETTERS
RELATING
TO
THE
PURCHASE
OF
THE
HOUSE
WERE
WITH
THE
TYPESCRIPT
OH
IF
WE
HAD
ONLY
HAD
THEM
EARLIER
WE
MIGHT
HAVE
SAVED
POOR
LUCY
STOP
THAT
WAY
MADNESS
LIES
HARKER
HAS
GONE
BACK
AND
IS
AGAIN
COLLATING
HIS
MATERIAL
HE
SAYS
THAT
BY
DINNER
TIME
THEY
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
SHOW
A
WHOLE
CONNECTED
NARRATIVE
HE
THINKS
THAT
IN
THE
MEANTIME
I
SHOULD
SEE
RENFIELD
AS
HITHERTO
HE
HAS
BEEN
A
SORT
OF
INDEX
TO
THE
COMING
AND
GOING
OF
THE
COUNT
I
HARDLY
SEE
THIS
YET
BUT
WHEN
I
GET
AT
THE
DATES
I
SUPPOSE
I
SHALL
WHAT
A
GOOD
THING
THAT
MRS
HARKER
PUT
MY
CYLINDERS
INTO
TYPE
WE
NEVER
COULD
HAVE
FOUND
THE
DATES
OTHERWISE
I
FOUND
RENFIELD
SITTING
PLACIDLY
IN
HIS
ROOM
WITH
HIS
HANDS
FOLDED
SMILING
BENIGNLY
AT
THE
MOMENT
HE
SEEMED
AS
SANE
AS
ANY
ONE
I
EVER
SAW
I
SAT
DOWN
AND
TALKED
WITH
HIM
ON
A
LOT
OF
SUBJECTS
ALL
OF
WHICH
HE
TREATED
NATURALLY
HE
THEN
OF
HIS
OWN
ACCORD
SPOKE
OF
GOING
HOME
A
SUBJECT
HE
HAS
NEVER
MENTIONED
TO
MY
KNOWLEDGE
DURING
HIS
SOJOURN
HERE
IN
FACT
HE
SPOKE
QUITE
CONFIDENTLY
OF
GETTING
HIS
DISCHARGE
AT
ONCE
I
BELIEVE
THAT
HAD
I
NOT
HAD
THE
CHAT
WITH
HARKER
AND
READ
THE
LETTERS
AND
THE
DATES
OF
HIS
OUTBURSTS
I
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
PREPARED
TO
SIGN
FOR
HIM
AFTER
A
BRIEF
TIME
OF
OBSERVATION
AS
IT
IS
I
AM
DARKLY
SUSPICIOUS
ALL
THOSE
OUTBREAKS
WERE
IN
SOME
WAY
LINKED
WITH
THE
PROXIMITY
OF
THE
COUNT
WHAT
THEN
DOES
THIS
ABSOLUTE
CONTENT
MEAN
CAN
IT
BE
THAT
HIS
INSTINCT
IS
SATISFIED
AS
TO
THE
VAMPIRE
S
ULTIMATE
TRIUMPH
STAY
HE
IS
HIMSELF
ZOOPHAGOUS
AND
IN
HIS
WILD
RAVINGS
OUTSIDE
THE
CHAPEL
DOOR
OF
THE
DESERTED
HOUSE
HE
ALWAYS
SPOKE
OF
MASTER
THIS
ALL
SEEMS
CONFIRMATION
OF
OUR
IDEA
HOWEVER
AFTER
A
WHILE
I
CAME
AWAY
MY
FRIEND
IS
JUST
A
LITTLE
TOO
SANE
AT
PRESENT
TO
MAKE
IT
SAFE
TO
PROBE
HIM
TOO
DEEP
WITH
QUESTIONS
HE
MIGHT
BEGIN
TO
THINK
AND
THEN
SO
I
CAME
AWAY
I
MISTRUST
THESE
QUIET
MOODS
OF
HIS
SO
I
HAVE
GIVEN
THE
ATTENDANT
A
HINT
TO
LOOK
CLOSELY
AFTER
HIM
AND
TO
HAVE
A
STRAIT
WAISTCOAT
READY
IN
CASE
OF

ARE
HOSPITABLE
WITH
TRUE
YORKSHIRE
HOSPITALITY
GIVE
A
GUEST
EVERYTHING
AND
LEAVE
HIM
FREE
TO
DO
AS
HE
LIKES
THEY
ALLKNEW
THAT
I
WAS
BUSY
AND
THAT
MY
STAY
WAS
SHORT
AND
MR
BILLINGTON
HADREADY
IN
HIS
OFFICE
ALL
THE
PAPERS
CONCERNING
THE
CONSIGNMENT
OF
BOXES
IT
GAVE
ME
ALMOST
A
TURN
TO
SEE
AGAIN
ONE
OF
THE
LETTERS
WHICH
I
HADSEEN
ON
THE
COUNT
S
TABLE
BEFORE
I
KNEW
OF
HIS
DIABOLICAL
PLANS
EVERYTHING
HAD
BEEN
CAREFULLY
THOUGHT
OUT
AND
DONE
SYSTEMATICALLY
ANDWITH
PRECISION
HE
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
BEEN
PREPARED
FOR
EVERY
OBSTACLE
WHICHMIGHT
BE
PLACED
BY
ACCIDENT
IN
THE
WAY
OF
HIS
INTENTIONS
BEING
CARRIEDOUT
TO
USE
AN
AMERICANISM
HE
HAD
TAKEN
NO
CHANCES
AND
THE
ABSOLUTEACCURACY
WITH
WHICH
HIS
INSTRUCTIONS
WERE
FULFILLED
WAS
SIMPLY
THELOGICAL
RESULT
OF
HIS
CARE
I
SAW
THE
INVOICE
AND
TOOK
NOTE
OF
IT
FIFTY
CASES
OF
COMMON
EARTH
TO
BE
USED
FOR
EXPERIMENTAL
PURPOSES
ALSO
THE
COPY
OF
LETTER
TO
CARTER
PATERSON
AND
THEIR
REPLY
OF
BOTH
OFTHESE
I
GOT
COPIES
THIS
WAS
ALL
THE
INFORMATION
MR
BILLINGTON
COULDGIVE
ME
SO
I
WENT
DOWN
TO
THE
PORT
AND
SAW
THE
COASTGUARDS
THE
CUSTOMSOFFICERS
AND
THE
HARBOUR
MASTER
THEY
HAD
ALL
SOMETHING
TO
SAY
OF
THESTRANGE
ENTRY
OF
THE
SHIP
WHICH
IS
ALREADY
TAKING
ITS
PLACE
IN
LOCALTRADITION
BUT
NO
ONE
COULD
ADD
TO
THE
SIMPLE
DESCRIPTION
FIFTY
CASESOF
COMMON
EARTH
I
THEN
SAW
THE
STATION
MASTER
WHO
KINDLY
PUT
ME
INCOMMUNICATION
WITH
THE
MEN
WHO
HAD
ACTUALLY
RECEIVED
THE
BOXES
THEIRTALLY
WAS
EXACT
WITH
THE
LIST
AND
THEY
HAD
NOTHING
TO
ADD
EXCEPT
THATTHE
BOXES
WERE
MAIN
AND
MORTAL
HEAVY
AND
THAT
SHIFTING
THEM
WAS
DRYWORK
ONE
OF
THEM
ADDED
THAT
IT
WAS
HARD
LINES
THAT
THERE
WASN
T
ANYGENTLEMAN
SUCH
LIKE
AS
YOURSELF
SQUIRE
TO
SHOW
SOME
SORT
OFAPPRECIATION
OF
THEIR
EFFORTS
IN
A
LIQUID

ANOTHER
PUT
IN

THE
THIRST
THEN
GENERATED
WAS
SUCH
THAT
EVEN
THE

WHICH
HADELAPSED
HAD
NOT
COMPLETELY
ALLAYED
IT
NEEDLESS
TO
ADD
I
TOOK
CAREBEFORE
LEAVING
TO

FOR
EVER
AND
ADEQUATELY
THIS
SOURCE
OFREPROACH
SEPTEMBER
THE
STATION
MASTER
WAS
GOOD
ENOUGH
TO
GIVE
ME
A
LINE
TOHIS
OLD
COMPANION
THE
STATION
MASTER
AT
KING
S

SO
THAT
WHEN
IARRIVED
THERE
IN
THE
MORNING
I
WAS
ABLE
TO
ASK
HIM
ABOUT
THE
ARRIVAL
OFTHE
BOXES
HE
TOO
PUT
ME
AT

IN

WITH
THE
PROPEROFFICIALS
AND
I
SAW
THAT

DARK
HAVING

I
COULD
WELL
BELIEVE
HIM
BUT
IF
HE
KNEW
WHATI
KNOW
HE
WOULD
I
THINK
HAVE
RAISED
HIS
TERMS
OF
ONE
THING
I
AM
NOW
SATISFIED
THAT
ALL
THE
BOXES
WHICH
ARRIVED
ATWHITBY
FROM
VARNA
IN
THE
DEMETER
WERE
SAFELY
DEPOSITED
IN

AT

OF

AND
I
HAVE
WORKED
ALL

AND
WE
HAVE
PUT
ALL
THE

MINA
HARKER
S
JOURNAL
SEPTEMBER
I
AM
SO
GLAD
THAT
I
HARDLY
KNOW
HOW
TO
CONTAIN
MYSELF
IT
IS
I
SUPPOSE
THE
REACTION
FROM
THE
HAUNTING
FEAR
WHICH
I
HAVE
HAD
THAT
THIS
TERRIBLE
AFFAIR
AND
THE
REOPENING
OF
HIS
OLD
WOUND
MIGHT
ACTDETRIMENTALLY
ON
JONATHAN
I
SAW
HIM
LEAVE
FOR
WHITBY
WITH
AS
BRAVE
AFACE
AS
I
COULD
BUT
I
WAS
SICK
WITH
APPREHENSION
THE
EFFORT
HAS
HOWEVER
DONE
HIM
GOOD
HE
WAS
NEVER
SO
RESOLUTE
NEVER
SO
STRONG
NEVERSO
FULL
OF
VOLCANIC
ENERGY
AS
AT
PRESENT
IT
IS
JUST
AS
THAT
DEAR
GOODPROFESSOR
VAN
HELSING
SAID
HE
IS
TRUE
GRIT
AND
HE
IMPROVES
UNDERSTRAIN
THAT
WOULD
KILL
A
WEAKER
NATURE
HE
CAME
BACK
FULL
OF
LIFE
ANDHOPE
AND
DETERMINATION
WE
HAVE
GOT
EVERYTHING
IN
ORDER
FOR
TO
NIGHT
IFEEL
MYSELF
QUITE
WILD
WITH
EXCITEMENT
I
SUPPOSE
ONE
OUGHT
TO
PITY
ANYTHING
SO
HUNTED
AS
IS
THE
COUNT
THAT
IS
JUST
IT
THIS
THING
IS
NOTHUMAN
NOT
EVEN
BEAST
TO
READ
DR
SEWARD
S
ACCOUNT
OF
POOR
LUCY
SDEATH
AND
WHAT
FOLLOWED
IS
ENOUGH
TO
DRY
UP
THE
SPRINGS
OF
PITY
INONE
S
HEART
LATER
LORD
GODALMING
AND
MR
MORRIS
ARRIVED
EARLIER
THAN
WEEXPECTED
DR
SEWARD
WAS
OUT
ON
BUSINESS
AND
HAD
TAKEN
JONATHAN
WITHHIM
SO
I
HAD
TO
SEE
THEM
IT
WAS
TO
ME
A
PAINFUL
MEETING
FOR
ITBROUGHT
BACK
ALL
POOR
DEAR
LUCY
S
HOPES
OF
ONLY
A
FEW
MONTHS
AGO
OFCOURSE
THEY
HAD
HEARD
LUCY
SPEAK
OF
ME
AND
IT
SEEMED
THAT
DR
VANHELSING
TOO
HAS
BEEN
QUITE
BLOWING
MY
TRUMPET
AS
MR
MORRISEXPRESSED
IT
POOR
FELLOWS
NEITHER
OF
THEM
IS
AWARE
THAT
I
KNOW
ALLABOUT
THE
PROPOSALS
THEY
MADE
TO
LUCY
THEY
DID
NOT
QUITE
KNOW
WHAT
TOSAY
OR
DO
AS
THEY
WERE
IGNORANT
OF
THE
AMOUNT
OF
MY
KNOWLEDGE
SO
THEYHAD
TO
KEEP
ON
NEUTRAL
SUBJECTS
HOWEVER
I
THOUGHT
THE
MATTER
OVER
ANDCAME
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
THE
BEST
THING
I
COULD
DO
WOULD
BE
TO
POSTTHEM
IN
AFFAIRS
RIGHT
UP
TO
DATE
I
KNEW
FROM
DR
SEWARD
S
DIARY
THATTHEY
HAD
BEEN
AT
LUCY
S
DEATH
HER
REAL
DEATH
AND
THAT
I
NEED
NOT
FEARTO
BETRAY
ANY
SECRET
BEFORE
THE
TIME
SO
I
TOLD
THEM
AS
WELL
AS
ICOULD
THAT
I
HAD
READ
ALL
THE
PAPERS
AND
DIARIES
AND
THAT
MY
HUSBANDAND
I
HAVING
TYPEWRITTEN
THEM
HAD
JUST
FINISHED
PUTTING
THEM
IN
ORDER
I
GAVE
THEM
EACH
A
COPY
TO
READ
IN
THE
LIBRARY
WHEN
LORD
GODALMING
GOTHIS
AND
TURNED
IT
OVER
IT
DOES
MAKE
A
PRETTY
GOOD
PILE
HE
SAID
DID
YOU
WRITE
ALL
THIS
MRS
HARKER
I
NODDED
AND
HE
WENT
ON
I
DON
T
QUITE
SEE
THE
DRIFT
OF
IT
BUT
YOU
PEOPLE
ARE
ALL
SO
GOOD
ANDKIND
AND
HAVE
BEEN
WORKING
SO
EARNESTLY
AND
SO
ENERGETICALLY
THAT
ALLI
CAN
DO
IS
TO
ACCEPT
YOUR
IDEAS
BLINDFOLD
AND
TRY
TO
HELP
YOU
I
HAVEHAD
ONE
LESSON
ALREADY
IN
ACCEPTING
FACTS
THAT
SHOULD
MAKE
A
MAN
HUMBLETO
THE
LAST
HOUR
OF
HIS
LIFE
BESIDES
I
KNOW
YOU
LOVED
MY
POOR
LUCY
HERE
HE
TURNED
AWAY
AND
COVERED
HIS
FACE
WITH
HIS
HANDS
I
COULD
HEARTHE
TEARS
IN
HIS
VOICE
MR
MORRIS
WITH
INSTINCTIVE
DELICACY
JUST
LAIDA
HAND
FOR
A
MOMENT
ON
HIS
SHOULDER
AND
THEN
WALKED
QUIETLY
OUT
OF
THEROOM
I
SUPPOSE
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
IN
WOMAN
S
NATURE
THAT
MAKES
A
MANFREE
TO
BREAK
DOWN
BEFORE
HER
AND
EXPRESS
HIS
FEELINGS
ON
THE
TENDER
OREMOTIONAL
SIDE
WITHOUT
FEELING
IT
DEROGATORY
TO
HIS
MANHOOD
FOR
WHENLORD
GODALMING
FOUND
HIMSELF
ALONE
WITH
ME
HE
SAT
DOWN
ON
THE
SOFA
ANDGAVE
WAY
UTTERLY
AND
OPENLY
I
SAT
DOWN
BESIDE
HIM
AND
TOOK
HIS
HAND
IHOPE
HE
DIDN
T
THINK
IT
FORWARD
OF
ME
AND
THAT
IF
HE
EVER
THINKS
OF
ITAFTERWARDS
HE
NEVER
WILL
HAVE
SUCH
A
THOUGHT
THERE
I
WRONG
HIM
I
KNOW
HE
NEVER
WILL
HE
IS
TOO
TRUE
A
GENTLEMAN
I
SAID
TO
HIM
FOR
ICOULD
SEE
THAT
HIS
HEART
WAS
BREAKING
I
LOVED
DEAR
LUCY
AND
I
KNOW
WHAT
SHE
WAS
TO
YOU

WHAT
YOU
WERE

NOW
SHE
IS

TO
YOU
IN
YOUR

I
KNOW
WHAT
SORROWS

THE
DEPTH
OF
THEM

ME
BE
OF
SOME

HYSTERICAL
AND
RAISING

TOGETHER
IN
A
PERFECT
AGONY
OF

STOOD
UP
AND
THEN
SATDOWN
AGAIN
AND
THE
TEARS
RAINED
DOWN
HIS
CHEEKS
I
FELT
AN
INFINITEPITY
FOR
HIM
AND
OPENED
MY
ARMS
UNTHINKINGLY
WITH
A
SOB
HE
LAID
HISHEAD
ON
MY
SHOULDER
AND
CRIED
LIKE
A
WEARIED

AT

TIME
HOW
STRANGE
IT
ALL
WAS
AFTER
A
LITTLE
BIT
HIS
SOBS
CEASED
AND
HE
RAISED
HIMSELF
WITH
ANAPOLOGY
THOUGH
HE
MADE
NO
DISGUISE
OF
HIS
EMOTION
HE
TOLD
ME
THAT
FORDAYS
AND
NIGHTS
PAST
WEARY
DAYS
AND
SLEEPLESS
NIGHTS

HAD
BEENUNABLE
TO
SPEAK
WITH

I
GOT

AT
FIVE
O
CLOCK
AND
FOUND
THAT
GODALMINGAND
MORRIS
HAD
NOT
ONLY
ARRIVED
BUT
HAD
ALREADY
STUDIED
THE
TRANSCRIPTOF
THE
VARIOUS
DIARIES
AND
LETTERS
WHICH

AND
HIS
WONDERFUL
WIFEHAD
MADE
AND
ARRANGED
HARKER
HAD
NOT

RETURNED
FROM
HIS
VISIT
TO
THECARRIERS
MEN
OF
WHOM
DR
HENNESSEY
HAD
WRITTEN
TO
ME
MRS
HARKER
GAVEUS
A
CUP
OF
TEA
AND
I
CAN
HONESTLY
SAY
THAT
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
SINCE
IHAVE
LIVED
IN
IT
THIS
OLD
HOUSE
SEEMED
LIKE
HOME
WHEN
WE
HADFINISHED
MRS
HARKER
SAID
DR
SEWARD
MAY
I
ASK
A
FAVOUR
I
WANT
TO
SEE
YOUR
PATIENT
MR
RENFIELD
DO
LET
ME
SEE
HIM
WHAT
YOU
HAVE
SAID
OF
HIM
IN
YOUR
DIARYINTERESTS
ME
SO
MUCH
SHE
LOOKED
SO
APPEALING
AND
SO
PRETTY
THAT
ICOULD
NOT
REFUSE
HER
AND
THERE
WAS
NO
POSSIBLE
REASON
WHY
I
SHOULD
SOI
TOOK
HER
WITH
ME
WHEN
I
WENT
INTO
THE
ROOM
I
TOLD
THE
MAN
THAT
ALADY
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SEE
HIM
TO
WHICH
HE
SIMPLY
ANSWERED
WHY
SHE
IS
GOING
THROUGH
THE
HOUSE
AND
WANTS
TO
SEE
EVERY
ONE
IN
IT
IANSWERED
OH
VERY
WELL
HE
SAID

HER
COME
IN
BY
ALL
MEANS
BUTJUST
WAIT
A
MINUTE
TILL
I
TIDY
UP
THE
PLACE
HIS
METHOD
OF
TIDYING
WASPECULIAR
HE
SIMPLY
SWALLOWED
ALL
THE
FLIES
AND
SPIDERS
IN
THE
BOXESBEFORE
I
COULD
STOP
HIM
IT
WAS
QUITE
EVIDENT
THAT
HE
FEARED
OR
WASJEALOUS
OF
SOME
INTERFERENCE
WHEN
HE
HAD
GOT
THROUGH
HIS
DISGUSTINGTASK
HE
SAID
CHEERFULLY
LET
THE
LADY
COME
IN
AND
SAT
DOWN
ON
THEEDGE
OF
HIS
BED
WITH
HIS
HEAD
DOWN
BUT
WITH
HIS
EYELIDS
RAISED
SO
THATHE
COULD
SEE
HER
AS
SHE
ENTERED
FOR
A
MOMENT
I
THOUGHT
THAT
HE
MIGHTHAVE
SOME
HOMICIDAL
INTENT
I
REMEMBERED
HOW
QUIET
HE
HAD
BEEN
JUSTBEFORE
HE
ATTACKED
ME
IN
MY
OWN
STUDY
AND
I
TOOK
CARE
TO
STAND
WHERE
ICOULD
SEIZE
HIM
AT
ONCE
IF
HE
ATTEMPTED
TO
MAKE
A
SPRING
AT
HER
SHECAME
INTO
THE
ROOM
WITH
AN
EASY
GRACEFULNESS
WHICH
WOULD
AT
ONCE
COMMANDTHE
RESPECT
OF
ANY
LUNATIC
FOR
EASINESS
IS
ONE
OF
THE
QUALITIES
MADPEOPLE
MOST
RESPECT
SHE
WALKED
OVER
TO
HIM
SMILING
PLEASANTLY
ANDHELD
OUT
HER
HAND
GOOD
EVENING
MR
RENFIELD
SAID
SHE
YOU
SEE
I
KNOW
YOU
FOR
DR
SEWARD
HAS
TOLD
ME
OF
YOU
HE
MADE
NO
IMMEDIATE
REPLY
BUT
EYED
HER
ALLOVER
INTENTLY
WITH
A
SET
FROWN
ON
HIS
FACE
THIS
LOOK
GAVE
WAY
TO
ONEOF
WONDER
WHICH
MERGED
IN
DOUBT
THEN
TO
MY
INTENSE
ASTONISHMENT
HESAID
YOU
RE
NOT
THE
GIRL
THE
DOCTOR
WANTED
TO
MARRY
ARE
YOU
YOU
CAN
T
BE
YOU
KNOW
FOR
SHE
S
DEAD
MRS
HARKER
SMILED
SWEETLY
AS
SHE
REPLIED
OH
NO
I
HAVE
A
HUSBAND
OF
MY
OWN
TO
WHOM
I
WAS
MARRIED
BEFORE
I
EVERSAW
DR
SEWARD
OR
HE
ME
I
AM
MRS
HARKER
THEN
WHAT
ARE
YOU
DOING
HERE
MY
HUSBAND
AND
I
ARE
STAYING
ON
A
VISIT
WITH
DR
SEWARD
THEN
DON
T
STAY
BUT
WHY
NOT
I
THOUGHT
THAT
THIS
STYLE
OF
CONVERSATION
MIGHT
NOT
BEPLEASANT
TO
MRS
HARKER
ANY
MORE
THAN
IT
WAS
TO
ME
SO
I
JOINED
IN
HOW
DID
YOU
KNOW
I
WANTED
TO
MARRY
ANY
ONE
HIS
REPLY
WAS
SIMPLYCONTEMPTUOUS
GIVEN
IN
A
PAUSE
IN
WHICH
HE
TURNED
HIS
EYES
FROM
MRS
HARKER
TO
ME
INSTANTLY
TURNING
THEM
BACK
AGAIN
WHAT
AN
ASININE
QUESTION
I
DON
T
SEE
THAT
AT
ALL
MR
RENFIELD
SAID
MRS
HARKER
AT
ONCECHAMPIONING
ME
HE
REPLIED
TO
HER
WITH
AS
MUCH
COURTESY
AND
RESPECT
ASHE
HAD
SHOWN
CONTEMPT
TO
ME
YOU
WILL
OF
COURSE
UNDERSTAND
MRS
HARKER
THAT
WHEN
A
MAN
IS
SOLOVED
AND
HONOURED
AS
OUR
HOST
IS
EVERYTHING
REGARDING
HIM
IS
OFINTEREST
IN
OUR
LITTLE
COMMUNITY
DR
SEWARD
IS
LOVED
NOT
ONLY
BY
HISHOUSEHOLD
AND
HIS
FRIENDS
BUT
EVEN
BY
HIS
PATIENTS
WHO
BEING
SOME
OFTHEM
HARDLY
IN
MENTAL
EQUILIBRIUM
ARE
APT
TO
DISTORT
CAUSES
ANDEFFECTS
SINCE
I
MYSELF
HAVE
BEEN
AN
INMATE
OF
A
LUNATIC
ASYLUM
ICANNOT
BUT
NOTICE
THAT
THE
SOPHISTIC
TENDENCIES
OF
SOME
OF
ITS
INMATESLEAN
TOWARDS
THE
ERRORS
OF
NON
CAUSA
AND
IGNORATIO
ELENCHI
IPOSITIVELY
OPENED
MY
EYES
AT
THIS
NEW
DEVELOPMENT
HERE
WAS
MY
OWN
PETLUNATIC
THE
MOST
PRONOUNCED
OF
HIS
TYPE
THAT
I
HAD
EVER
METWITH
TALKING
ELEMENTAL
PHILOSOPHY
AND
WITH
THE
MANNER
OF
A
POLISHEDGENTLEMAN
I
WONDER
IF
IT
WAS
MRS
HARKER
S
PRESENCE
WHICH
HAD
TOUCHEDSOME
CHORD
IN
HIS
MEMORY
IF
THIS
NEW
PHASE
WAS
SPONTANEOUS
OR
IN
ANYWAY
DUE
TO
HER
UNCONSCIOUS
INFLUENCE
SHE
MUST
HAVE
SOME
RARE
GIFT
ORPOWER
WE
CONTINUED
TO
TALK
FOR
SOME
TIME
AND
SEEING
THAT
HE
WAS
SEEMINGLYQUITE
REASONABLE
SHE
VENTURED
LOOKING
AT
ME
QUESTIONINGLY
AS
SHEBEGAN
TO
LEAD
HIM
TO
HIS
FAVOURITE
TOPIC
I
WAS
AGAIN
ASTONISHED
FORHE
ADDRESSED
HIMSELF
TO
THE
QUESTION
WITH
THE
IMPARTIALITY
OF
THECOMPLETEST
SANITY
HE
EVEN
TOOK
HIMSELF
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
WHEN
HE
MENTIONEDCERTAIN
THINGS
WHY
I
MYSELF
AM
AN
INSTANCE
OF
A
MAN
WHO
HAD
A
STRANGE
BELIEF
INDEED
IT
WAS
NO
WONDER
THAT
MY
FRIENDS
WERE
ALARMED
AND
INSISTED
ON
MY
BEINGPUT
UNDER
CONTROL
I
USED
TO
FANCY
THAT

WAS
A
POSITIVE

AND
THAT
BY

A
MULTITUDE
OF

THINGS
NOMATTER
HOW
LOW
IN
THE
SCALE
OF

ONE
MIGHT
INDEFINITELY
PROLONGLIFE
AT

I
HELD
THE
BELIEF
SO
STRONGLY
THAT
I
ACTUALLY
TRIED
TOTAKE

THE
DOCTOR
HERE
WILL
BEAR
ME
OUT
THAT
ON
ONE
OCCASION
ITRIED
TO
KILL
HIM
FOR
THE

OF
STRENGTHENING
MY

POWERS
BYTHE

WITH

THROUGH

EQUALLY
IN

PLACE
BECAUSE
WE

ANDSECONDLY
BECAUSE
AFTER
ALL
THESE

EVERYTHING

HISNAME
AGAINST

OVER
THE

ON
THE

OFTURKEY

IF

SO
THEN
WAS

NO

AND
FOR
CENTURIES
AFTER
HE
WAS
SPOKEN
OF
AS
THE
CLEVEREST
AND
THE
MOSTCUNNING
AS
WELL
AS
THE
BRAVEST
OF
THE
SONS
OF
THE

BEYOND
THEFOREST
THAT
MIGHTY
BRAIN
AND
THAT
IRON
RESOLUTION
WENT
WITH
HIM
TO
HISGRAVE
AND
ARE
EVEN
NOW
ARRAYED
AGAINST

THE
DRACULAS
WERE
SAYSARMINIUS
A
GREAT
AND
NOBLE
RACE
THOUGH
NOW
AND
AGAIN
WERE
SCIONS
WHOWERE
HELD
BY
THEIR
COEVALS
TO
HAVE
HAD

WITH
THE
EVIL
ONE
THEYLEARNED
HIS
SECRETS
IN
THE

AMONGST
THE

OVER

WHERE
THE

CLAIMS

ARE
SUCH

AS

THIS

THERE
HAVE

AND
GOOD

AND
THEIRGRAVES
MAKE
SACRED
THE
EARTH
WHERE
ALONE
THIS
FOULNESS
CAN
DWELL
FOR
ITIS
NOT
THE
LEAST
OF
ITS
TERRORS
THAT
THIS
EVIL
THING
IS
ROOTED
DEEP
INALL
GOOD
IN
SOIL
BARREN
OF
HOLY
MEMORIES
IT
CANNOT
REST
WHILST
THEY
WERE
TALKING
MR
MORRIS
WAS
LOOKING
STEADILY
AT
THE
WINDOW
AND
HE
NOW
GOT
UP
QUIETLY
AND
WENT
OUT
OF
THE
ROOM
THERE
WAS
A
LITTLEPAUSE
AND
THEN
THE
PROFESSOR
WENT
ON
AND
NOW
WE
MUST
SETTLE
WHAT
WE
DO
WE
HAVE
HERE
MUCH
DATA
AND
WE
MUSTPROCEED
TO
LAY
OUT
OUR
CAMPAIGN
WE
KNOW
FROM
THE
INQUIRY
OF
JONATHANTHAT
FROM
THE
CASTLE
TO
WHITBY
CAME
FIFTY
BOXES
OF
EARTH
ALL
OF
WHICHWERE
DELIVERED
AT
CARFAX
WE
ALSO
KNOW
THAT
AT
LEAST
SOME
OF
THESE
BOXESHAVE
BEEN
REMOVED
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
OUR
FIRST
STEP
SHOULD
BE
TOASCERTAIN
WHETHER
ALL
THE
REST
REMAIN
IN
THE
HOUSE
BEYOND
THAT
WALLWHERE
WE
LOOK
TO
DAY
OR
WHETHER
ANY
MORE
HAVE
BEEN
REMOVED
IF
THELATTER
WE
MUST
TRACE
HERE
WE
WERE
INTERRUPTED
IN
A
VERY
STARTLING
WAY
OUTSIDE
THE
HOUSE
CAMETHE
SOUND
OF
A
PISTOL
SHOT
THE
GLASS
OF
THE

WAS
SHATTERED
WITH
ABULLET
WHICH
RICOCHETTING
FROM
THE
TOP
OF
THE
EMBRASURE
STRUCK
THEFAR
WALL
OF
THE

I
AM
AFRAID
I
AM
AT

A
COWARD
FOR
I
SHRIEKEDOUT
THE
MEN
ALL
JUMPED
TO
THEIR
FEET
LORD
GODALMING
FLEW
OVER
TO
THEWINDOW
AND
THREW
UP
THE
SASH
AS
HE
DID
SO
WE
HEARD
MR
MORRIS
S
VOICEWITHOUT
SORRY
I
FEAR
I
HAVE
ALARMED
YOU
I
SHALL
COME
IN
AND
TELL
YOU
ABOUTIT
A
MINUTE
LATER
HE
CAME
IN
AND
SAID
IT
WAS
AN
IDIOTIC
THING
OF
ME
TO
DO
AND
I
ASK
YOUR
PARDON
MRS
HARKER
MOST
SINCERELY
I
FEAR
I
MUST
HAVE
FRIGHTENED
YOU
TERRIBLY
BUTTHE
FACT
IS
THAT
WHILST
THE
PROFESSOR
WAS
TALKING
THERE
CAME
A
BIG
BATAND
SAT
ON
THE
WINDOW
SILL
I
HAVE
GOT
SUCH
A
HORROR
OF
THE
DAMNEDBRUTES
FROM
RECENT
EVENTS
THAT
I
CANNOT
STAND
THEM
AND
I
WENT
OUT
TOHAVE
A
SHOT
AS
I
HAVE
BEEN
DOING
OF
LATE
OF
EVENINGS
WHENEVER
I
HAVESEEN
ONE
YOU
USED
TO
LAUGH
AT
ME
FOR
IT
THEN
ART
DID
YOU
HIT
IT
ASKED
DR
VAN
HELSING
I
DON
T
KNOW
I
FANCY
NOT
FOR
IT
FLEW
AWAY
INTO
THE
WOOD
WITHOUTSAYING
ANY
MORE
HE
TOOK
HIS
SEAT
AND
THE
PROFESSOR
BEGAN
TO
RESUME
HISSTATEMENT
WE
MUST
TRACE
EACH
OF
THESE
BOXES
AND
WHEN
WE
ARE
READY
WE
MUSTEITHER
CAPTURE
OR
KILL
THIS
MONSTER
IN
HIS
LAIR
OR
WE
MUST
SO
TOSPEAK
STERILISE
THE
EARTH
SO
THAT
NO
MORE
HE
CAN
SEEK
SAFETY
IN
IT
THUS
IN
THE
END
WE
MAY
FIND
HIM
IN
HIS
FORM
OF
MAN
BETWEEN
THE
HOURS
OFNOON
AND
SUNSET
AND
SO
ENGAGE
WITH
HIM
WHEN
HE
IS
AT
HIS
MOST
WEAK
AND
NOW
FOR
YOU
MADAM
MINA
THIS
NIGHT
IS
THE
END
UNTIL
ALL
BE
WELL
YOU
ARE
TOO
PRECIOUS
TO
US
TO
HAVE
SUCH
RISK
WHEN
WE
PART
TO
NIGHT
YOUNO
MORE
MUST
QUESTION
WE
SHALL
TELL
YOU
ALL
IN
GOOD
TIME
WE
ARE
MENAND
ARE
ABLE
TO
BEAR
BUT
YOU
MUST
BE
OUR
STAR
AND
OUR
HOPE
AND
WESHALL
ACT
ALL
THE
MORE
FREE
THAT
YOU
ARE
NOT
IN
THE
DANGER
SUCH
AS
WEARE
ALL
THE
MEN
EVEN
JONATHAN
SEEMED
RELIEVED
BUT
IT
DID
NOT
SEEM
TO
MEGOOD
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
BRAVE
DANGER
AND
PERHAPS
LESSEN
THEIRSAFETY
STRENGTH
BEING
THE
BEST
SAFETY
THROUGH
CARE
OF
ME
BUT
THEIRMINDS
WERE
MADE
UP
AND
THOUGH
IT
WAS
A
BITTER
PILL
FOR
ME
TO
SWALLOW
I
COULD
SAY
NOTHING
SAVE
TO
ACCEPT
THEIR
CHIVALROUS
CARE
OF
ME
MR

RESUMED
THE
DISCUSSION
AS
THERE
IS
NO
TIME
TO
LOSE
I

VICTIM
I
OWN
THAT
MY
HEART
BEGAN
TO
FAIL
ME
WHEN
THE
TIME
FOR
ACTION
CAME
SOCLOSE
BUT
I
DID
NOT
SAY
ANYTHING
FOR
I
HAD
A
GREATER
FEAR
THAT
IF
IAPPEARED
AS
A
DRAG
OR
A
HINDRANCE
TO
THEIR
WORK
THEY
MIGHT
EVEN
LEAVEME
OUT
OF
THEIR
COUNSELS
ALTOGETHER
THEY
HAVE
NOW
GONE
OFF
TO
CARFAX
WITH
MEANS
TO
GET
INTO

MANLIKE
THEY
HAD
TOLD
ME
TO
GO
TO

AND
SLEEP
AS

CANSLEEP
WHEN
THOSE
SHE
LOVES
ARE
IN

IN
A
STATE
OF
CONSIDERABLE
EXCITEMENT
BUT
FAR
MORERATIONAL
IN
HIS
SPEECH
AND
MANNER
THAN
I
HAD
EVER
SEEN
HIM
THERE
WAS
ANUNUSUAL
UNDERSTANDING
OF
HIMSELF
WHICH
WAS
UNLIKE
ANYTHING
I
HAD
EVERMET
WITH
IN
A
LUNATIC

HE
TOOK

ASTONISHED
THAT
THE
ODDNESS
OFINTRODUCING
A

NOT

MORAL
DUTY

CIRCUMSTANCES
HE
MADE
THIS
LASTAPPEAL
WITH
A
COURTLY
AIR
OF
CONVICTION

NOT

ITS
OWNCHARM
I
THINK
WE
WERE
ALL
STAGGERED
FOR
MY

PART
I
WAS
UNDER
THECONVICTION
DESPITE
MY
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
MAN

THAT
HIS

HAD
BEEN
RESTORED
AND
I
FELT
UNDER
A
STRONG

TOTELL
HIM
THAT
I
WAS
SATISFIED
AS
TO
HIS
SANITY
AND
WOULD
SEE
ABOUT
THENECESSARY
FORMALITIES
FOR

IN

I
THOUGHT
ITBETTER
TO

HOWEVER
BEFORE
MAKING
SO
GRAVE
A
STATEMENT
FOR
OF
OLDI
KNEW
THE
SUDDEN
CHANGES
TO
WHICH
THIS
PARTICULAR
PATIENT
WAS
LIABLE
SO
I
CONTENTED
MYSELF
WITH
MAKING
A
GENERAL
STATEMENT
THAT
HE
APPEAREDTO
BE
IMPROVING
VERY
RAPIDLY
THAT
I
WOULD
HAVE
A
LONGER
CHAT
WITH
HIMIN
THE
MORNING
AND
WOULD
THEN
SEE
WHAT
I
COULD
DO
IN
THE
DIRECTION
OFMEETING
HIS
WISHES
THIS
DID
NOT
AT
ALL
SATISFY
HIM
FOR
HE
SAIDQUICKLY
BUT
I
FEAR

THAT
YOU
HARDLY
APPREHEND
MY
WISH

DESIRE
TOGO
AT

IT
IS
OFTHE
ESSENCE
OF
THE
CONTRACT
I
AM
SURE
IT
IS
ONLY
NECESSARY
TO
PUTBEFORE
SO
ADMIRABLE
A
PRACTITIONER
AS
DR

SO
SIMPLE

SOMOMENTOUS
A

I
SAID
FRANKLY
BUT
AT
THE

TIME
AS
I
FELT
BRUTALLY
THERE
WAS
A
CONSIDERABLE
PAUSE
AND
THEN
HE
SAID
SLOWLY
THEN
I
SUPPOSE

MUST
ONLY
SHIFT

AND
SO
DETERMINED

WENT
ON
COME

BUT
I
AM
NOT

IN

I
CAN
ONLY
ASK
YOU
TO
TRUST
ME
IF
I
AMREFUSED
THE

NOT
REST
WITH

I
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
NOWTIME
TO

WHICH
WAS
BECOMING
TOO
COMICALLY
GRAVE
SO
I
WENTTOWARDS
THE

SIMPLY
SAYING
COME

AS
HOWEVER
I
GOT
NEAR
THE

A
NEW
CHANGE
CAME
OVER
THE
PATIENT
HEMOVED
TOWARDS
ME
SO
QUICKLY
THAT
FOR
THE
MOMENT
I
FEARED
THAT
HE
WASABOUT
TO
MAKE
ANOTHER
HOMICIDAL
ATTACK
MY
FEARS
HOWEVER
WEREGROUNDLESS
FOR
HE
HELD
UP
HIS
TWO
HANDS
IMPLORINGLY
AND
MADE
HISPETITION
IN
A
MOVING
MANNER
AS
HE
SAW
THAT
THE
VERY
EXCESS
OF
HISEMOTION
WAS
MILITATING
AGAINST
HIM
BY
RESTORING
US
MORE
TO
OUR
OLDRELATIONS
HE
BECAME
STILL
MORE
DEMONSTRATIVE
I
GLANCED
AT
VAN
HELSING
AND
SAW
MY
CONVICTION
REFLECTED
IN
HIS
EYES
SO
I
BECAME
A
LITTLE
MOREFIXED
IN
MY
MANNER
IF
NOT
MORE
STERN
AND
MOTIONED
TO
HIM
THAT
HISEFFORTS
WERE

SOME

OFWHICH
AT

INTOQUITE
A

I
WENT
WITH

TO
THE
SEARCH
WITH
AN
EASYMIND
FOR
I
THINK
I
NEVER
SAW
MINA
SO
ABSOLUTELY
STRONG
AND
WELL
I
AMSO
GLAD
THAT
SHE
CONSENTED
TO
HOLD
BACK
AND
LET
US
MEN
DO
THE
WORK
SOMEHOW
IT
WAS
A
DREAD
TO
ME
THAT
SHE
WAS
IN
THIS
FEARFUL
BUSINESS
ATALL
BUT
NOW
THAT
HER
WORK
IS
DONE
AND
THAT
IT
IS
DUE
TO
HER
ENERGY
ANDBRAINS
AND
FORESIGHT
THAT
THE
WHOLE
STORY
IS
PUT
TOGETHER
IN
SUCH
A
WAYTHAT
EVERY
POINT
TELLS
SHE
MAY
WELL
FEEL
THAT
HER
PART
IS
FINISHED
ANDTHAT
SHE
CAN
HENCEFORTH
LEAVE
THE
REST
TO
US
WE
WERE
I
THINK
ALL
ALITTLE
UPSET
BY
THE
SCENE
WITH
MR
RENFIELD
WHEN
WE
CAME
AWAY
FROM
HISROOM
WE
WERE
SILENT
TILL
WE
GOT
BACK
TO
THE
STUDY
THEN
MR

SAIDTO
DR

SAY
JACK
IF
THAT
MAN
WASN
T
ATTEMPTING
A
BLUFF
HE
IS
ABOUT
THESANEST
LUNATIC
I
EVER
SAW
I
M
NOT
SURE
BUT
I
BELIEVE
THAT
HE
HAD
SOMESERIOUS
PURPOSE
AND
IF
HE
HAD
IT
WAS
PRETTY
ROUGH
ON
HIM
NOT
TO
GET
ACHANCE
LORD
GODALMING
AND
I
WERE
SILENT
BUT
DR

ADDED
FRIEND
JOHN
YOU
KNOW
MORE
OF
LUNATICS
THAN
I
DO
AND
I
M
GLAD
OF
IT
FOR
I
FEAR
THAT
IF
IT
HAD
BEEN
TO
ME
TO
DECIDE
I
WOULD
BEFORE
THAT
LASTHYSTERICAL
OUTBURST
HAVE
GIVEN
HIM
FREE
BUT
WE
LIVE
AND
LEARN
AND
INOUR
PRESENT
TASK
WE
MUST
TAKE
NO
CHANCE
AS
MY
FRIEND
QUINCEY
WOULD
SAY
ALL
IS
BEST
AS
THEY
ARE
DR
SEWARD
SEEMED
TO
ANSWER
THEM
BOTH
IN
ADREAMY
KIND
OF
WAY
I
DON
T
KNOW
BUT
THAT
I
AGREE
WITH
YOU
IF
THAT
MAN
HAD
BEEN
ANORDINARY
LUNATIC
I
WOULD
HAVE
TAKEN
MY
CHANCE
OF
TRUSTING
HIM
BUT
HESEEMS
SO
MIXED
UP
WITH
THE
COUNT
IN
AN
INDEXY
KIND
OF
WAY
THAT
I
AMAFRAID
OF
DOING
ANYTHING
WRONG
BY
HELPING
HIS
FADS
I
CAN
T
FORGET
HOWHE
PRAYED
WITH
ALMOST
EQUAL
FERVOUR
FOR
A
CAT
AND
THEN
TRIED
TO
TEAR
MYTHROAT
OUT
WITH
HIS
TEETH
BESIDES
HE
CALLED
THE
COUNT
LORD
ANDMASTER
AND
HE
MAY
WANT
TO
GET
OUT
TO
HELP
HIM
IN
SOME
DIABOLICAL
WAY
THAT
HORRID
THING
HAS
THE
WOLVES
AND
THE
RATS
AND
HIS

MYSELF
DOING
THE
WHOLE
PLACE
WAS
THICK
WITH
DUST
THE
FLOOR
WAS
SEEMINGLY
INCHESDEEP
EXCEPT
WHERE
THERE
WERE
RECENT
FOOTSTEPS
IN
WHICH
ON
HOLDING
DOWNMY
LAMP
I
COULD
SEE
MARKS
OF
HOBNAILS
WHERE
THE
DUST
WAS
CRACKED
THEWALLS
WERE
FLUFFY
AND
HEAVY
WITH
DUST
AND
IN
THE
CORNERS
WERE
MASSES
OFSPIDER
S
WEBS
WHEREON
THE
DUST
HAD
GATHERED
TILL
THEY
LOOKED
LIKE
OLDTATTERED
RAGS
AS
THE
WEIGHT
HAD
TORN
THEM
PARTLY
DOWN
ON
A
TABLE
IN
THEHALL
WAS
A
GREAT
BUNCH
OF
KEYS
WITH
A
TIME
YELLOWED
LABEL
ON
EACH
THEYHAD
BEEN
USED
SEVERAL
TIMES
FOR
ON
THE
TABLE
WERE
SEVERAL
SIMILAR
RENTSIN
THE
BLANKET
OF
DUST
SIMILAR
TO
THAT
EXPOSED
WHEN
THE
PROFESSORLIFTED
THEM
HE
TURNED
TO
ME
AND
SAID
YOU
KNOW
THIS
PLACE
JONATHAN
YOU
HAVE
COPIED
MAPS
OF
IT
AND
YOU
KNOWIT
AT
LEAST
MORE
THAN
WE
DO
WHICH
IS
THE
WAY
TO
THE
CHAPEL
I
HAD
ANIDEA
OF
ITS
DIRECTION
THOUGH
ON
MY
FORMER
VISIT
I
HAD
NOT
BEEN
ABLE
TOGET
ADMISSION
TO
IT
SO
I
LED
THE
WAY
AND
AFTER
A
FEW
WRONG
TURNINGSFOUND
MYSELF
OPPOSITE
A
LOW
ARCHED
OAKEN
DOOR
RIBBED
WITH
IRON
BANDS
THIS
IS
THE
SPOT
SAID
THE
PROFESSOR
AS
HE
TURNED
HIS
LAMP
ON
A
SMALLMAP
OF
THE
HOUSE
COPIED
FROM
THE
FILE
OF
MY
ORIGINAL
CORRESPONDENCEREGARDING
THE
PURCHASE
WITH
A
LITTLE
TROUBLE
WE
FOUND
THE
KEY
ON
THEBUNCH
AND
OPENED
THE
DOOR
WE
WERE
PREPARED
FOR
SOME
UNPLEASANTNESS
FORAS
WE
WERE
OPENING
THE
DOOR
A
FAINT
MALODOROUS
AIR
SEEMED
TO
EXHALETHROUGH
THE
GAPS
BUT
NONE
OF
US
EVER
EXPECTED
SUCH
AN
ODOUR
AS
WEENCOUNTERED
NONE
OF
THE
OTHERS
HAD
MET
THE
COUNT
AT
ALL
AT
CLOSEQUARTERS
AND
WHEN
I
HAD
SEEN
HIM
HE
WAS
EITHER
IN
THE
FASTING
STAGE
OFHIS
EXISTENCE
IN
HIS
ROOMS
OR
WHEN
HE
WAS
GLOATED
WITH
FRESH
BLOOD
INA
RUINED
BUILDING
OPEN
TO
THE
AIR
BUT
HERE
THE
PLACE
WAS
SMALL
ANDCLOSE
AND
THE
LONG
DISUSE
HAD
MADE
THE
AIR
STAGNANT
AND
FOUL
THERE
WASAN
EARTHY
SMELL
AS
OF
SOME
DRY
MIASMA
WHICH
CAME
THROUGH
THE
FOULERAIR
BUT
AS
TO
THE
ODOUR
ITSELF
HOW
SHALL
I
DESCRIBE
IT
IT
WAS
NOTALONE
THAT
IT
WAS
COMPOSED
OF
ALL
THE
ILLS
OF
MORTALITY
AND
WITH
THEPUNGENT
ACRID
SMELL
OF
BLOOD
BUT
IT
SEEMED
AS
THOUGH
CORRUPTION
HADBECOME
ITSELF
CORRUPT
FAUGH
IT
SICKENS
ME
TO
THINK
OF
IT
EVERY
BREATHEXHALED
BY
THAT
MONSTER
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
CLUNG
TO
THE
PLACE
ANDINTENSIFIED
ITS
LOATHSOMENESS
UNDER
ORDINARY
CIRCUMSTANCES
SUCH
A
STENCH
WOULD
HAVE
BROUGHT
OURENTERPRISE
TO
AN
END
BUT
THIS
WAS
NO
ORDINARY
CASE
AND
THE
HIGH
ANDTERRIBLE
PURPOSE
IN
WHICH
WE
WERE
INVOLVED
GAVE
US
A
STRENGTH
WHICH
ROSEABOVE
MERELY
PHYSICAL
CONSIDERATIONS
AFTER
THE
INVOLUNTARY
SHRINKINGCONSEQUENT
ON
THE
FIRST
NAUSEOUS
WHIFF
WE
ONE
AND
ALL
SET
ABOUT
OURWORK
AS
THOUGH
THAT
LOATHSOME
PLACE
WERE
A
GARDEN
OF
ROSES
WE
MADE
AN
ACCURATE
EXAMINATION
OF
THE
PLACE
THE
PROFESSOR
SAYING
AS
WEBEGAN
THE
FIRST
THING
IS
TO
SEE
HOW
MANY
OF
THE
BOXES
ARE
LEFT
WE
MUST
THENEXAMINE
EVERY
HOLE
AND
CORNER
AND
CRANNY
AND
SEE
IF
WE
CANNOT
GET
SOMECLUE
AS
TO
WHAT
HAS
BECOME
OF
THE
REST
A
GLANCE
WAS
SUFFICIENT
TO
SHOWHOW
MANY
REMAINED
FOR
THE
GREAT
EARTH
CHESTS
WERE
BULKY
AND
THERE
WASNO
MISTAKING
THEM
THERE
WERE
ONLY
TWENTY
NINE
LEFT
OUT
OF
THE
FIFTY
ONCE
I
GOT
A
FRIGHT
FOR
SEEING
LORD
GODALMING
SUDDENLY
TURN
AND
LOOK
OUT
OF
THE
VAULTEDDOOR
INTO
THE
DARK
PASSAGE
BEYOND
I
LOOKED
TOO
AND
FOR
AN
INSTANT
MYHEART
STOOD
STILL
SOMEWHERE
LOOKING
OUT
FROM
THE
SHADOW
I
SEEMED
TOSEE
THE
HIGH
LIGHTS
OF
THE
COUNT
S
EVIL
FACE
THE
RIDGE
OF
THE
NOSE
THERED
EYES
THE
RED
LIPS
THE
AWFUL
PALLOR
IT
WAS
ONLY
FOR
A
MOMENT
FOR
AS
LORD
GODALMING
SAID
I
THOUGHT
I
SAW
A
FACE
BUT
IT
WAS
ONLY
THESHADOWS
AND
RESUMED
HIS
INQUIRY
I
TURNED
MY
LAMP
IN
THE
DIRECTION
AND
STEPPED
INTO
THE
PASSAGE
THERE
WAS
NO
SIGN
OF
ANY
ONE
AND
AS
THEREWERE
NO
CORNERS
NO
DOORS
NO
APERTURE
OF
ANY
KIND
BUT
ONLY
THE
SOLIDWALLS
OF
THE
PASSAGE
THERE
COULD
BE
NO
HIDING
PLACE
EVEN
FOR
HIM
ITOOK
IT
THAT
FEAR
HAD
HELPED
IMAGINATION
AND
SAID
NOTHING
A
FEW
MINUTES
LATER
I
SAW
MORRIS
STEP
SUDDENLY
BACK
FROM
A
CORNER
WHICHHE
WAS
EXAMINING
WE
ALL
FOLLOWED
HIS
MOVEMENTS
WITH
OUR
EYES
FORUNDOUBTEDLY
SOME
NERVOUSNESS
WAS
GROWING
ON
US
AND
WE
SAW
A
WHOLE
MASSOF
PHOSPHORESCENCE
WHICH
TWINKLED
LIKE
STARS
WE
ALL
INSTINCTIVELY
DREWBACK
THE
WHOLE
PLACE
WAS
BECOMING
ALIVE
WITH
RATS
FOR
A
MOMENT
OR
TWO
WE
STOOD
APPALLED
ALL
SAVE
LORD
GODALMING
WHO
WASSEEMINGLY
PREPARED
FOR
SUCH
AN
EMERGENCY
RUSHING
OVER
TO
THE
GREATIRON
BOUND
OAKEN

DR
SEWARD

DESCRIBED
FROM
THE

WHICH
I
HAD
SEEN
MYSELF
HE
TURNED
THE
KEY
IN
THE
LOCK
DREW
THEHUGE
BOLTS
AND
SWUNG
THE
DOOR
OPEN
THEN
TAKING
HIS
LITTLE
SILVERWHISTLE
FROM
HIS

HE
BLEW
A
LOW
SHRILL
CALL
IT
WAS
ANSWEREDFROM
BEHIND
DR
SEWARD
S
HOUSE
BY
THE
YELPING
OF
DOGS
AND
AFTER
ABOUT
AMINUTE
THREE
TERRIERS
CAME
DASHING
ROUND
THE
CORNER
OF
THE
HOUSE
UNCONSCIOUSLY
WE
HAD
ALL
MOVED
TOWARDS
THE
DOOR
AND
AS
WE
MOVED
INOTICED
THAT
THE
DUST
HAD
BEEN
MUCH
DISTURBED
THE
BOXES
WHICH
HAD
BEENTAKEN
OUT
HAD
BEEN
BROUGHT
THIS
WAY
BUT
EVEN
IN
THE
MINUTE
THAT
HADELAPSED
THE
NUMBER
OF
THE

VASTLY
INCREASED
THEY
SEEMED
TOSWARM
OVER
THE

ALL
AT
ONCE
TILL
THE
LAMPLIGHT
SHINING
ON
THEIRMOVING
DARK
BODIES
AND
GLITTERING
BALEFUL

MADE
THE

LOOKLIKE
A

AT

SUDDENLY
STOPPED

OF

AND
CARRYING

IN
PLACED

TOUCHED

SEEMED
TORECOVER
HIS

AND
RUSHED
AT

THEY
FLED

SO
FAST
THAT

BEEN
LIFTED
IN
THE

BUT
SMALL

THE

AND
BARKED
MERRILY
AS
THEY

TOSSED
THEM
INTHE

VICIOUS
SHAKES
WE
ALL
SEEMED

WHETHER
IT
WAS
THE
PURIFYING
OF
THE
DEADLY
ATMOSPHERE
BY
THE

OFTHE

OR
THE

WHICH
WE
EXPERIENCED
BY
FINDING
OURSELVESIN
THE

I
KNOW
NOT
BUT
MOST
CERTAINLY
THE

OF
DREAD
SEEMED
TOSLIP
FROM

LIKE
A

AND
THE
OCCASION
OF
OUR

WHEN
I
HAD

NEVER

DID
THE

EXHIBIT
ANY

OF
UNEASINESS
AND
EVEN
WHENWE
RETURNED
TO

THEY
FRISKED
ABOUT
AS
THOUGH
THEY

IN
A

THE
MORNING
WAS

IN

WHEN
WE

FEARED
MIGHT

AND

WE
HAVE
ASCERTAINED
HOWMANY
BOXES
ARE
MISSING
MORE
THAN
ALL
DO
I
REJOICE
THAT
THIS
OURFIRST
AND
PERHAPS
OUR
MOST
DIFFICULT
AND
DANGEROUS
STEP
HAS
BEENACCOMPLISHED
WITHOUT

WHICH
SHE
MIGHT
NEVER

ONE
LESSON
TOO

HAVELEARNED
IF

THAT
THE

HE
SUMMON

THAT

HE
HAS
NOT

OVER
THE
BRUTE
WORLD
FOR
THE
ONLY
OR
THE
LAST
TIME
TO

SO
BE
IT
THAT
HE
HAS
GONE
ELSEWHERE
GOOD
IT
HAS
GIVEN
US
OPPORTUNITYTO
CRY
CHECK
IN
SOME
WAYS
IN
THIS
CHESS
GAME
WHICH
WE
PLAY
FOR
THESTAKE
OF
HUMAN
SOULS
AND
NOW
LET
US
GO
HOME
THE
DAWN
IS
CLOSE
AT
HAND
AND
WE
HAVE
REASON
TO
BE
CONTENT
WITH
OUR
FIRST
NIGHT
S
WORK
IT
MAY
BEORDAINED
THAT
WE
HAVE
MANY
NIGHTS
AND
DAYS
TO
FOLLOW
IF
FULL
OF
PERIL
BUT
WE
MUST
GO
ON
AND
FROM
NO
DANGER
SHALL
WE
SHRINK
THE
HOUSE
WAS
SILENT
WHEN
WE
GOT
BACK
SAVE
FOR
SOME
POOR
CREATURE
WHOWAS
SCREAMING
AWAY
IN
ONE
OF
THE
DISTANT
WARDS
AND
A
LOW
MOANING
SOUNDFROM
RENFIELD
S
ROOM
THE
POOR
WRETCH
WAS
DOUBTLESS
TORTURING
HIMSELF
AFTER
THE
MANNER
OF
THE
INSANE
WITH
NEEDLESS
THOUGHTS
OF
PAIN
I
CAME
TIPTOE
INTO
OUR
OWN
ROOM
AND
FOUND
MINA
ASLEEP
BREATHING
SOSOFTLY
THAT
I
HAD
TO
PUT
MY
EAR
DOWN
TO
HEAR
IT
SHE
LOOKS
PALER
THANUSUAL
I
HOPE
THE
MEETING
TO
NIGHT
HAS
NOT
UPSET
HER
I
AM
TRULYTHANKFUL
THAT
SHE
IS
TO
BE
LEFT
OUT
OF
OUR
FUTURE
WORK
AND
EVEN
OF
OURDELIBERATIONS
IT
IS
TOO
GREAT
A
STRAIN
FOR
A
WOMAN
TO
BEAR
I
DID
NOTTHINK
SO
AT
FIRST
BUT
I
KNOW
BETTER
NOW
THEREFORE
I
AM
GLAD
THAT
IT
ISSETTLED
THERE
MAY
BE
THINGS
WHICH
WOULD
FRIGHTEN
HER
TO
HEAR
AND
YETTO
CONCEAL
THEM
FROM
HER
MIGHT
BE
WORSE
THAN
TO
TELL
HER
IF
ONCE
SHESUSPECTED
THAT
THERE
WAS
ANY
CONCEALMENT
HENCEFORTH
OUR
WORK
IS
TO
BE
ASEALED
BOOK
TO
HER
TILL
AT
LEAST
SUCH
TIME
AS
WE
CAN
TELL
HER
THAT
ALLIS
FINISHED
AND
THE
EARTH
FREE
FROM
A
MONSTER
OF
THE
NETHER
WORLD
IDARESAY
IT
WILL
BE
DIFFICULT
TO
BEGIN
TO
KEEP
SILENCE
AFTER
SUCHCONFIDENCE
AS
OURS
BUT
I
MUST
BE
RESOLUTE
AND
TO
MORROW
I
SHALL
KEEPDARK
OVER
TO
NIGHT
S
DOINGS
AND
SHALL
REFUSE
TO
SPEAK
OF
ANYTHING
THATHAS
HAPPENED
I
REST
ON
THE
SOFA
SO
AS
NOT
TO
DISTURB
HER
OCTOBER
LATER
I
SUPPOSE
IT
WAS
NATURAL
THAT
WE
SHOULD
HAVE
ALLOVERSLEPT
OURSELVES
FOR
THE
DAY
WAS
A
BUSY
ONE
AND
THE
NIGHT
HAD
NOREST
AT
ALL
EVEN
MINA
MUST
HAVE
FELT
ITS
EXHAUSTION
FOR
THOUGH
I
SLEPTTILL
THE
SUN
WAS
HIGH
I
WAS
AWAKE
BEFORE
HER
AND
HAD
TO
CALL
TWO
ORTHREE
TIMES
BEFORE
SHE
AWOKE
INDEED
SHE
WAS
SO
SOUND
ASLEEP
THAT
FOR
AFEW
SECONDS
SHE
DID
NOT
RECOGNIZE
ME
BUT
LOOKED
AT
ME
WITH
A
SORT
OFBLANK
TERROR
AS
ONE
LOOKS
WHO
HAS
BEEN
WAKED
OUT
OF
A
BAD
DREAM
SHECOMPLAINED
A
LITTLE
OF
BEING
TIRED
AND
I
LET
HER
REST
TILL
LATER
IN
THEDAY
WE
NOW
KNOW
OF
TWENTY
ONE
BOXES
HAVING
BEEN
REMOVED
AND
IF
IT
BETHAT
SEVERAL
WERE
TAKEN
IN
ANY
OF
THESE
REMOVALS
WE
MAY
BE
ABLE
TO
TRACETHEM
ALL
SUCH
WILL
OF
COURSE
IMMENSELY
SIMPLIFY
OUR
LABOUR
AND
THESOONER
THE
MATTER
IS
ATTENDED
TO
THE
BETTER
I
SHALL
LOOK
UP
THOMASSNELLING
TO
DAY
DR
SEWARD
S
DIARY
OCTOBER
IT
WAS
TOWARDS
NOON
WHEN
I
WAS
AWAKENED
BY
THE
PROFESSORWALKING
INTO
MY
ROOM
HE
WAS
MORE
JOLLY
AND
CHEERFUL
THAN
USUAL
AND
ITIS
QUITE
EVIDENT
THAT
LAST
NIGHT
S
WORK
HAS
HELPED
TO
TAKE
SOME
OF
THEBROODING
WEIGHT
OFF
HIS
MIND
AFTER
GOING
OVER
THE
ADVENTURE
OF
THENIGHT
HE
SUDDENLY
SAID
YOUR
PATIENT
INTERESTS
ME
MUCH
MAY
IT
BE
THAT
WITH
YOU
I
VISIT
HIMTHIS
MORNING
OR
IF
THAT
YOU
ARE
TOO
OCCUPY
I
CAN
GO
ALONE
IF
IT
MAYBE
IT
IS
A
NEW
EXPERIENCE
TO
ME
TO
FIND
A
LUNATIC
WHO
TALK
PHILOSOPHY
AND
REASON
SO
SOUND
I
HAD
SOME
WORK
TO
DO
WHICH
PRESSED
SO
I
TOLD
HIMTHAT
IF
HE
WOULD
GO
ALONE
I
WOULD
BE
GLAD
AS
THEN
I
SHOULD
NOT
HAVE
TOKEEP
HIM
WAITING
SO
I
CALLED
AN
ATTENDANT
AND
GAVE
HIM
THE
NECESSARYINSTRUCTIONS
BEFORE
THE
PROFESSOR
LEFT
THE
ROOM
I
CAUTIONED
HIM
AGAINSTGETTING
ANY
FALSE
IMPRESSION
FROM
MY
PATIENT
BUT
HE
ANSWERED
IWANT
HIM
TO
TALK
OF
HIMSELF
AND
OF
HIS
DELUSION
AS
TO
CONSUMING
LIVETHINGS
HE
SAID
TO
MADAM
MINA
AS
I
SEE
IN
YOUR
DIARY
OF
YESTERDAY
THATHE
HAD
ONCE
HAD
SUCH
A
BELIEF
WHY
DO
YOU
SMILE
FRIEND
JOHN
EXCUSE
ME
I
SAID
BUT
THE
ANSWER
IS
HERE
I
LAID
MY
HAND
ON
THETYPE
WRITTEN
MATTER
WHEN
OUR
SANE
AND
LEARNED
LUNATIC
MADE
THAT
VERYSTATEMENT
OF
HOW
HE
USED
TO
CONSUME
LIFE
HIS
MOUTH
WAS
ACTUALLYNAUSEOUS
WITH
THE
FLIES
AND
SPIDERS
WHICH
HE
HAD
EATEN
JUST
BEFORE
MRS
HARKER
ENTERED
THE
ROOM
VAN
HELSING
SMILED
IN
TURN
GOOD
HE
SAID
YOUR
MEMORY
IS
TRUE
FRIEND
JOHN
I
SHOULD
HAVE
REMEMBERED
AND
YET
ITIS
THIS
VERY
OBLIQUITY
OF
THOUGHT
AND
MEMORY
WHICH
MAKES
MENTAL
DISEASESUCH
A
FASCINATING
STUDY
PERHAPS
I
MAY
GAIN
MORE
KNOWLEDGE
OUT
OF
THEFOLLY
OF
THIS
MADMAN
THAN
I
SHALL
FROM
THE
TEACHING
OF
THE
MOST
WISE
WHO
KNOWS
I
WENT
ON
WITH
MY
WORK
AND
BEFORE
LONG
WAS
THROUGH
THAT
INHAND
IT
SEEMED
THAT
THE
TIME
HAD
BEEN
VERY
SHORT
INDEED
BUT
THERE
WASVAN
HELSING
BACK
IN
THE
STUDY
DO
I
INTERRUPT
HE
ASKED
POLITELY
AS
HESTOOD
AT
THE
DOOR
NOT
AT
ALL
I
ANSWERED
COME
IN
MY
WORK
IS
FINISHED
AND
I
AM
FREE
I
CAN
GO
WITH
YOU
NOW
IF
YOU
LIKE
IT
IS
NEEDLESS
I
HAVE
SEEN
HIM
WELL
I
FEAR
THAT
HE
DOES
NOT
APPRAISE
ME
AT
MUCH
OUR
INTERVIEW
WAS
SHORT
WHEN
I
ENTERED
HIS
ROOM
HE
WAS
SITTING
ON
A
STOOL
IN
THE
CENTRE
WITHHIS
ELBOWS
ON
HIS
KNEES
AND
HIS
FACE
WAS
THE
PICTURE
OF
SULLENDISCONTENT
I
SPOKE
TO
HIM
AS
CHEERFULLY
AS
I
COULD
AND
WITH
SUCH
AMEASURE
OF
RESPECT
AS
I
COULD
ASSUME
HE
MADE
NO
REPLY
WHATEVER
DON
TYOU
KNOW
ME
I
ASKED
HIS
ANSWER
WAS
NOT
REASSURING
I
KNOW
YOU
WELLENOUGH
YOU
ARE
THE
OLD
FOOL

I
WISH

YOUR
IDIOTIC
BRAIN

NOT
A

MY
ROUND
OF
WORK
AND
WE
SHALL
MEET
TO
NIGHT
MINA
HARKER
S
JOURNAL
OCTOBER
IT
IS
STRANGE
TO
ME
TO
BE
KEPT
IN
THE
DARK
AS
I
AM
TO
DAY
AFTER
JONATHAN
S
FULL
CONFIDENCE
FOR
SO
MANY
YEARS
TO
SEE
HIMMANIFESTLY
AVOID
CERTAIN
MATTERS
AND
THOSE
THE
MOST
VITAL
OF
ALL
THISMORNING
I
SLEPT
LATE
AFTER
THE
FATIGUES
OF
YESTERDAY
AND
THOUGHJONATHAN
WAS
LATE
TOO
HE
WAS
THE
EARLIER
HE
SPOKE
TO
ME
BEFORE
HE
WENTOUT
NEVER
MORE
SWEETLY
OR
TENDERLY
BUT
HE
NEVER
MENTIONED
A
WORD
OFWHAT
HAD
HAPPENED
IN
THE
VISIT
TO
THE
COUNT
S
HOUSE
AND
YET
HE
MUSTHAVE
KNOWN
HOW
TERRIBLY
ANXIOUS
I
WAS
POOR
DEAR
FELLOW
I
SUPPOSE
ITMUST
HAVE
DISTRESSED
HIM
EVEN
MORE
THAN
IT
DID
ME
THEY
ALL
AGREED
THATIT
WAS
BEST
THAT
I
SHOULD
NOT
BE
DRAWN
FURTHER
INTO
THIS
AWFUL
WORK
ANDI
ACQUIESCED
BUT
TO
THINK
THAT
HE
KEEPS
ANYTHING
FROM
ME
AND
NOW
I
AMCRYING
LIKE
A
SILLY
FOOL
WHEN
I
KNOW
IT
COMES
FROM
MY
HUSBAND
S
GREATLOVE
AND
FROM
THE
GOOD
GOOD
WISHES
OF
THOSE
OTHER
STRONG
MEN
THAT
HAS
DONE
ME
GOOD
WELL
SOME
DAY
JONATHAN
WILL
TELL
ME
ALL
ANDLEST
IT
SHOULD
EVER
BE
THAT
HE
SHOULD
THINK
FOR
A
MOMENT
THAT
I
KEPTANYTHING
FROM
HIM
I
STILL
KEEP
MY
JOURNAL
AS
USUAL
THEN
IF
HE
HASFEARED
OF
MY
TRUST
I
SHALL
SHOW
IT
TO
HIM
WITH
EVERY
THOUGHT
OF
MYHEART
PUT
DOWN
FOR
HIS
DEAR
EYES
TO
READ
I
FEEL
STRANGELY
SAD
ANDLOW
SPIRITED
TO
DAY
I
SUPPOSE
IT
IS
THE
REACTION
FROM
THE
TERRIBLEEXCITEMENT
LAST
NIGHT
I
WENT
TO
BED
WHEN
THE
MEN
HAD
GONE
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
THEY
TOLDME
TO
I
DIDN
T
FEEL
SLEEPY
AND
I
DID
FEEL
FULL
OF
DEVOURING
ANXIETY
IKEPT
THINKING
OVER
EVERYTHING
THAT
HAS
BEEN
EVER
SINCE
JONATHAN
CAME
TOSEE
ME
IN
LONDON
AND
IT
ALL
SEEMS
LIKE
A
HORRIBLE
TRAGEDY
WITH
FATEPRESSING
ON
RELENTLESSLY
TO
SOME
DESTINED
END
EVERYTHING
THAT
ONE
DOESSEEMS
NO
MATTER
HOW
RIGHT
IT
MAY
BE
TO
BRING
ON
THE
VERY
THING
WHICHIS
MOST
TO
BE
DEPLORED
IF
I
HADN
T
GONE
TO
WHITBY
PERHAPS
POOR
DEARLUCY
WOULD
BE
WITH
US
NOW
SHE
HADN
T
TAKEN
TO
VISITING
THE
CHURCHYARDTILL
I
CAME
AND
IF
SHE
HADN
T
COME
THERE
IN
THE
DAY
TIME
WITH
ME
SHEWOULDN
T
HAVE
WALKED
THERE
IN
HER
SLEEP
AND
IF
SHE
HADN
T
GONE
THERE
ATNIGHT
AND
ASLEEP
THAT
MONSTER
COULDN
T
HAVE
DESTROYED
HER
AS
HE
DID
OH
WHY
DID
I
EVER
GO
TO
WHITBY
THERE
NOW
CRYING
AGAIN
I
WONDER
WHATHAS
COME
OVER
ME
TO
DAY
I
MUST
HIDE
IT
FROM
JONATHAN
FOR
IF
HE
KNEWTHAT
I
HAD
BEEN
CRYING
TWICE
IN
ONE
MORNING
I
WHO
NEVER
CRIED
ON
MYOWN
ACCOUNT
AND
WHOM
HE
HAS
NEVER
CAUSED
TO
SHED
A
TEAR
THE
DEARFELLOW
WOULD
FRET
HIS
HEART
OUT
I
SHALL
PUT
A
BOLD
FACE
ON
AND
IF
I
DOFEEL
WEEPY
HE
SHALL
NEVER
SEE
IT
I
SUPPOSE
IT
IS
ONE
OF
THE
LESSONSTHAT
WE
POOR
WOMEN
HAVE
TO
LEARN
I
CAN
T
QUITE
REMEMBER
HOW
I
FELL
ASLEEP
LAST
NIGHT
I
REMEMBER
HEARINGTHE
SUDDEN
BARKING
OF
THE
DOGS
AND
A
LOT
OF
QUEER
SOUNDS
LIKE
PRAYINGON
A
VERY
TUMULTUOUS
SCALE
FROM
MR
RENFIELD
S
ROOM
WHICH
IS
SOMEWHEREUNDER
THIS
AND
THEN
THERE
WAS
SILENCE
OVER
EVERYTHING
SILENCE
SOPROFOUND
THAT
IT
STARTLED
ME
AND
I
GOT
UP
AND
LOOKED
OUT
OF
THE
WINDOW
ALL
WAS
DARK
AND
SILENT
THE
BLACK
SHADOWS
THROWN
BY
THE
MOONLIGHTSEEMING
FULL
OF
A
SILENT
MYSTERY
OF
THEIR
OWN
NOT
A
THING
SEEMED
TO
BESTIRRING
BUT
ALL
TO
BE
GRIM
AND
FIXED
AS
DEATH
OR
FATE
SO
THAT
A
THINSTREAK
OF
WHITE
MIST
THAT
CREPT
WITH
ALMOST
IMPERCEPTIBLE
SLOWNESSACROSS
THE
GRASS
TOWARDS
THE
HOUSE
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
A
SENTIENCE
AND
AVITALITY
OF
ITS
OWN
I
THINK
THAT
THE
DIGRESSION
OF
MY
THOUGHTS
MUSTHAVE
DONE
ME
GOOD
FOR
WHEN
I
GOT
BACK
TO
BED
I
FOUND
A
LETHARGYCREEPING
OVER
ME
I
LAY
A
WHILE
BUT
COULD
NOT
QUITE
SLEEP
SO
I
GOT
OUTAND
LOOKED
OUT
OF
THE
WINDOW
AGAIN
THE
MIST
WAS
SPREADING
AND
WAS
NOWCLOSE
UP
TO
THE
HOUSE
SO
THAT
I
COULD
SEE
IT
LYING
THICK
AGAINST
THEWALL
AS
THOUGH
IT
WERE
STEALING
UP
TO
THE
WINDOWS
THE
POOR
MAN
WASMORE
LOUD
THAN
EVER
AND
THOUGH
I
COULD
NOT
DISTINGUISH
A
WORD
HE
SAID
I
COULD
IN
SOME
WAY
RECOGNISE
IN
HIS
TONES
SOME
PASSIONATE
ENTREATY
ONHIS
PART
THEN
THERE
WAS
THE
SOUND
OF
A
STRUGGLE
AND
I
KNEW
THAT
THEATTENDANTS
WERE
DEALING
WITH
HIM
I
WAS
SO
FRIGHTENED
THAT
I
CREPT
INTOBED
AND
PULLED
THE
CLOTHES
OVER
MY
HEAD
PUTTING
MY
FINGERS
IN
MY
EARS
I
WAS
NOT
THEN
A
BIT
SLEEPY
AT
LEAST
SO
I
THOUGHT
BUT
I
MUST
HAVEFALLEN
ASLEEP
FOR
EXCEPT
DREAMS
I
DO
NOT
REMEMBER
ANYTHING
UNTIL
THEMORNING
WHEN
JONATHAN
WOKE
ME
I
THINK
THAT
IT
TOOK
ME
AN
EFFORT
AND
ALITTLE
TIME
TO
REALISE
WHERE
I
WAS
AND
THAT
IT
WAS
JONATHAN
WHO
WASBENDING
OVER
ME
MY
DREAM
WAS
VERY
PECULIAR
AND
WAS
ALMOST
TYPICAL
OFTHE
WAY
THAT
WAKING
THOUGHTS
BECOME
MERGED
IN
OR
CONTINUED
IN
DREAMS
I
THOUGHT
THAT
I
WAS
ASLEEP
AND
WAITING
FOR
JONATHAN
TO
COME
BACK
IWAS
VERY
ANXIOUS
ABOUT
HIM
AND
I
WAS
POWERLESS
TO
ACT
MY
FEET
AND
MYHANDS
AND
MY
BRAIN
WERE
WEIGHTED
SO
THAT
NOTHING
COULD
PROCEED
AT
THEUSUAL
PACE
AND
SO
I
SLEPT
UNEASILY
AND
THOUGHT
THEN
IT
BEGAN
TO
DAWNUPON
ME
THAT
THE
AIR
WAS
HEAVY
AND
DANK
AND
COLD
I
PUT
BACK
THECLOTHES
FROM
MY
FACE
AND
FOUND
TO
MY
SURPRISE
THAT
ALL
WAS
DIMAROUND
THE
GASLIGHT
WHICH
I
HAD
LEFT
LIT
FOR
JONATHAN
BUT
TURNED
DOWN
CAME
ONLY
LIKE
A
TINY
RED
SPARK
THROUGH
THE
FOG
WHICH
HAD
EVIDENTLYGROWN
THICKER
AND
POURED
INTO
THE
ROOM
THEN
IT
OCCURRED
TO
ME
THAT
IHAD
SHUT
THE
WINDOW
BEFORE
I
HAD
COME
TO
BED
I
WOULD
HAVE
GOT
OUT
TOMAKE
CERTAIN
ON
THE
POINT
BUT
SOME
LEADEN
LETHARGY
SEEMED
TO
CHAIN
MYLIMBS
AND
EVEN
MY
WILL
I
LAY
STILL
AND
ENDURED
THAT
WAS
ALL
I
CLOSEDMY
EYES
BUT
COULD
STILL
SEE
THROUGH
MY
EYELIDS
IT
IS
WONDERFUL
WHATTRICKS
OUR
DREAMS
PLAY
US
AND
HOW
CONVENIENTLY
WE
CAN
IMAGINE
THEMIST
GREW
THICKER
AND
THICKER
AND
I
COULD
SEE
NOW
HOW
IT
CAME
IN
FOR
ICOULD
SEE
IT
LIKE
SMOKE
OR
WITH
THE
WHITE
ENERGY
OF
BOILINGWATER
POURING
IN
NOT
THROUGH
THE
WINDOW
BUT
THROUGH
THE
JOININGS
OFTHE
DOOR
IT
GOT
THICKER
AND
THICKER
TILL
IT
SEEMED
AS
IF
IT
BECAMECONCENTRATED
INTO
A
SORT
OF
PILLAR
OF
CLOUD
IN
THE
ROOM
THROUGH
THE
TOPOF
WHICH
I
COULD
SEE
THE
LIGHT
OF
THE
GAS
SHINING
LIKE
A
RED
EYE
THINGSBEGAN
TO
WHIRL
THROUGH
MY
BRAIN
JUST
AS
THE
CLOUDY
COLUMN
WAS
NOWWHIRLING
IN
THE
ROOM
AND
THROUGH
IT
ALL
CAME
THE
SCRIPTURAL
WORDS
APILLAR
OF
CLOUD
BY
DAY
AND
OF
FIRE
BY
NIGHT
WAS
IT
INDEED
SOME
SUCHSPIRITUAL
GUIDANCE
THAT
WAS
COMING
TO
ME
IN
MY
SLEEP
BUT
THE
PILLAR
WASCOMPOSED
OF
BOTH
THE
DAY
AND
THE
NIGHT
GUIDING
FOR
THE
FIRE
WAS
IN
THERED
EYE
WHICH
AT
THE
THOUGHT
GOT
A
NEW
FASCINATION
FOR
ME
TILL
AS
ILOOKED
THE
FIRE
DIVIDED
AND
SEEMED
TO
SHINE
ON
ME
THROUGH
THE
FOG

AS

SUDDENLY
THE
HORROR

THOSE
AWFUL
WOMEN
GROWING
INTO

THROUGH

HAVE
FAINTED
FOR

THE

WAS
TOSHOW
ME
A
LIVID

JONATHAN
COMING
TO

BUT
THESLEEP
HAS
NOT

ME
FOR
TO
DAY
I
FEEL
TERRIBLY
WEAK
ANDSPIRITLESS
I
SPENT
ALL
YESTERDAY
TRYING
TO

OR
LYING
DOWN
DOZING
IN
THE
AFTERNOON
MR
RENFIELD
ASKED
IF
HE
MIGHT
SEE

POOR
MAN
HE
WASVERY
GENTLE
AND
WHEN
I
CAME
AWAY
HE
KISSED
MY
HAND
AND
BADE
GOD
BLESSME
SOME
WAY
IT
AFFECTED
ME
MUCH
I
AM
CRYING
WHEN
I
THINK
OF

THISIS
A
NEW
WEAKNESS
OF
WHICH
I
MUST
BE
CAREFUL
JONATHAN
WOULD
BEMISERABLE
IF
HE
KNEW
I
HAD

AND
THE
OTHERS
WERE
OUT
TILLDINNER
TIME
AND
THEY
ALL
CAME
IN
TIRED
I
DID
WHAT
I
COULD
TO
BRIGHTENTHEM

AND
I
SUPPOSE
THAT
THE
EFFORT
DID
ME
GOOD
FOR
I
FORGOT
HOWTIRED
I
WAS
AFTER
DINNER
THEY
SENT
ME
TO
BED
AND
ALL
WENT
OFF
TO

AS
THEY
SAID
BUT
I
KNEW
THAT
THEY
WANTED
TO
TELL
EACH
OTHEROF
WHAT
HAD
OCCURRED
TO
EACH
DURING
THE
DAY
I
COULD
SEE
FROM
JONATHAN
SMANNER
THAT
HE
HAD
SOMETHING
IMPORTANT
TO
COMMUNICATE
I
WAS
NOT
SOSLEEPY
AS
I
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
SO
BEFORE
THEY
WENT
I
ASKED
DR
SEWARD
TOGIVE
ME
A
LITTLE
OPIATE
OF
SOME
KIND
AS
I
HAD
NOT
SLEPT
WELL
THE
NIGHTBEFORE
HE
VERY
KINDLY
MADE
ME
UP
A
SLEEPING

WHICH
HE
GAVE
TOME
TELLING

THAT
IT
WOULD
DO
ME
NO

AS
IT
WAS
VERY
MILD
IHAVE
TAKEN
IT
AND
AM
WAITING
FOR

WHICH
STILL
KEEPS
ALOOF
I
HOPEI
HAVE
NOT
DONE
WRONG
FOR
AS
SLEEP
BEGINS
TO
FLIRT
WITH
ME
A
NEW
FEARCOMES
THAT
I
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
FOOLISH
IN

S
JOURNAL

EVENING
I
FOUND
THOMAS
SNELLING
IN
HIS
HOUSE
AT
BETHNALGREEN
BUT
UNHAPPILY
HE
WAS
NOT
IN
A
CONDITION
TO
REMEMBER
ANYTHING
THEVERY
PROSPECT
OF
BEER
WHICH
MY
EXPECTED
COMING
HAD
OPENED
TO
HIM
HADPROVED
TOO
MUCH
AND
HE
HAD
BEGUN
TOO
EARLY
ON
HIS
EXPECTED
DEBAUCH
ILEARNED
HOWEVER
FROM
HIS
WIFE
WHO
SEEMED
A
DECENT
POOR
SOUL
THAT
HEWAS
ONLY
THE
ASSISTANT
TO
SMOLLET
WHO
OF
THE
TWO
MATES
WAS
THERESPONSIBLE
PERSON
SO
OFF
I
DROVE
TO
WALWORTH
AND
FOUND
MR

AND
IN
HIS
SHIRTSLEEVES

A
LATE
TEA
OUT
OF
ASAUCER
HE
IS
A
DECENT
INTELLIGENT
FELLOW
DISTINCTLY
A
GOOD
RELIABLETYPE
OF
WORKMAN
AND
WITH
A
HEADPIECE
OF
HIS
OWN
HE
REMEMBERED
ALLABOUT
THE
INCIDENT
OF
THE
BOXES
AND
FROM
A
WONDERFUL

SO
THAT

DOWN

STEPS
TILL
THE
LOTOF

WENT
AWAY
CUSSIN
I
THOUGHT
THAT
WITH
THIS
DESCRIPTION
I
COULDFIND
THE
HOUSE
SO
HAVING
PAID
MY
FRIEND
FOR
HIS
INFORMATION
I
STARTEDOFF
FOR
PICCADILLY
I
HAD
GAINED
A
NEW
PAINFUL
EXPERIENCE
THE
COUNTCOULD
IT
WAS
EVIDENT
HANDLE
THE
EARTH
BOXES
HIMSELF
IF
SO
TIME
WASPRECIOUS
FOR
NOW
THAT
HE
HAD
ACHIEVED
A
CERTAIN
AMOUNT
OFDISTRIBUTION
HE
COULD
BY
CHOOSING
HIS
OWN
TIME
COMPLETE
THE
TASKUNOBSERVED
AT
PICCADILLY
CIRCUS
I
DISCHARGED
MY
CAB
AND
WALKEDWESTWARD
BEYOND
THE
JUNIOR
CONSTITUTIONAL
I
CAME
ACROSS
THE
HOUSEDESCRIBED
AND
WAS
SATISFIED
THAT
THIS
WAS
THE
NEXT
OF
THE
LAIRSARRANGED
BY
DRACULA
THE
HOUSE
LOOKED
AS
THOUGH
IT
HAD
BEEN
LONGUNTENANTED
THE
WINDOWS
WERE
ENCRUSTED
WITH
DUST
AND
THE
SHUTTERS
WEREUP
ALL
THE
FRAMEWORK
WAS
BLACK
WITH
TIME
AND
FROM
THE
IRON
THE
PAINTHAD
MOSTLY
SCALED
AWAY
IT
WAS
EVIDENT
THAT
UP
TO
LATELY
THERE
HAD
BEENA
LARGE
NOTICE
BOARD
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
BALCONY
IT
HAD
HOWEVER
BEENROUGHLY
TORN
AWAY
THE
UPRIGHTS
WHICH
HAD
SUPPORTED
IT
STILL
REMAINING
BEHIND
THE
RAILS
OF
THE
BALCONY
I
SAW
THERE
WERE
SOME
LOOSE
BOARDS
WHOSE
RAW
EDGES
LOOKED
WHITE
I
WOULD
HAVE
GIVEN
A
GOOD
DEAL
TO
HAVEBEEN
ABLE
TO
SEE
THE
NOTICE
BOARD
INTACT
AS
IT
WOULD
PERHAPS
HAVEGIVEN
SOME
CLUE
TO
THE
OWNERSHIP
OF
THE
HOUSE
I
REMEMBERED
MYEXPERIENCE
OF
THE
INVESTIGATION
AND
PURCHASE
OF
CARFAX
AND
I
COULD
NOTBUT
FEEL
THAT
IF
I
COULD
FIND
THE
FORMER
OWNER
THERE
MIGHT
BE
SOME
MEANSDISCOVERED
OF
GAINING
ACCESS
TO
THE
HOUSE
THERE
WAS
AT
PRESENT
NOTHING
TO
BE
LEARNED
FROM
THE
PICCADILLY
SIDE
ANDNOTHING
COULD
BE
DONE
SO
I
WENT
ROUND
TO
THE
BACK
TO
SEE
IF
ANYTHINGCOULD
BE
GATHERED
FROM
THIS
QUARTER
THE
MEWS
WERE
ACTIVE
THEPICCADILLY
HOUSES
BEING
MOSTLY
IN
OCCUPATION
I
ASKED
ONE
OR
TWO
OF
THEGROOMS
AND
HELPERS
WHOM
I
SAW
AROUND
IF
THEY
COULD
TELL
ME
ANYTHINGABOUT
THE
EMPTY
HOUSE
ONE
OF
THEM
SAID
THAT
HE
HEARD
IT
HAD
LATELY
BEENTAKEN
BUT
HE
COULDN
T
SAY
FROM
WHOM
HE
TOLD
ME
HOWEVER
THAT
UP
TOVERY
LATELY
THERE
HAD
BEEN
A
NOTICE
BOARD
OF
FOR
SALE
UP
AND
THATPERHAPS
MITCHELL
SONS
CANDY
THE
HOUSE
AGENTS
COULD
TELL
MESOMETHING
AS
HE
THOUGHT
HE
REMEMBERED
SEEING
THE
NAME
OF
THAT
FIRM
ONTHE
BOARD
I
DID
NOT
WISH
TO
SEEM
TOO
EAGER
OR
TO
LET
MY
INFORMANT
KNOWOR
GUESS
TOO
MUCH
SO
THANKING
HIM
IN
THE
USUAL
MANNER
I
STROLLEDAWAY
IT
WAS
NOW
GROWING
DUSK
AND
THE
AUTUMN
NIGHT
WAS
CLOSING
IN
SO
IDID
NOT
LOSE
ANY
TIME
HAVING
LEARNED

BUTUNCOMMUNICATIVE
IN

PROPORTION
HAVING
ONCE
TOLD
ME
THAT
THEPICCADILLY
HOUSE
WHICH
THROUGHOUT
OUR
INTERVIEW
HE
CALLED
A
MANSION
WAS
SOLD
HE
CONSIDERED
MY
BUSINESS
AS
CONCLUDED
WHEN
IASKED
WHO
HAD
PURCHASED
IT
HE
OPENED
HIS
EYES
A
THOUGHT
WIDER
ANDPAUSED
A
FEW
SECONDS
BEFORE
REPLYING
IT
IS
SOLD
SIR
PARDON
ME
I
SAID
WITH
EQUAL
POLITENESS
BUT
I
HAVE
A
SPECIAL
REASONFOR
WISHING

AGAIN
HE
PAUSED
LONGER
AND
RAISED
HIS
EYEBROWS
STILL
MORE
IT
IS
SOLD
SIR
WAS
AGAIN
HIS
LACONIC
REPLY
SURELY
I
SAID
YOU
DO
NOT
MIND
LETTING

ANSWERED
THE
AFFAIRS
OF
THEIR
CLIENTS

SAFE
IN
THE
HANDS
OF
MITCHELL
SONS
CANDY
THIS
WASMANIFESTLY
A
PRIG
OF

WATER
AND
THERE
WAS
NO
USE
ARGUING
WITHHIM
I
THOUGHT
I
HAD
BEST

HIM
ON

GROUND
SO
I
SAID

RESOLUTE
A
GUARDIAN
OF

SORAPIDLY

MORE
THAN

THEY
FORM
A
MORETHAN
INTERESTING
STUDY
THIS
MORNING
WHEN
I
WENT
TO
SEE
HIM
AFTER
HISREPULSE
OF
VAN
HELSING
HIS
MANNER
WAS
THAT
OF
A
MAN
COMMANDING
DESTINY
HE
WAS
IN
FACT
COMMANDING
DESTINY
SUBJECTIVELY
HE
DID
NOT
REALLYCARE
FOR
ANY
OF
THE
THINGS
OF
MERE
EARTH
HE
WAS
IN
THE
CLOUDS
ANDLOOKED
DOWN
ON
ALL
THE
WEAKNESSES
AND
WANTS
OF
US
POOR
MORTALS
ITHOUGHT
I
WOULD
IMPROVE
THE
OCCASION
AND
LEARN
SOMETHING
SO
I
ASKEDHIM
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
FLIES
THESE
TIMES
HE
SMILED
ON
ME
IN
QUITE
A
SUPERIORSORT
OF
WAY
SUCH
A
SMILE
AS
WOULD
HAVE
BECOME
THE
FACE
OF
MALVOLIO
ASHE
ANSWERED
ME
THE
FLY
MY
DEAR
SIR
HAS
ONE
STRIKING
FEATURE
ITS
WINGS
ARE
TYPICALOF
THE
AERIAL
POWERS
OF
THE
PSYCHIC
FACULTIES
THE
ANCIENTS
DID
WELLWHEN
THEY
TYPIFIED
THE
SOUL
AS
A
BUTTERFLY
I
THOUGHT
I
WOULD
PUSH
HIS
ANALOGY
TO
ITS
UTMOST
LOGICALLY
SO
I
SAIDQUICKLY
OH
IT
IS
A
SOUL
YOU
ARE
AFTER
NOW
IS
IT
HIS
MADNESS
FOILED
HISREASON
AND
A
PUZZLED
LOOK
SPREAD
OVER
HIS
FACE
AS
SHAKING
HIS
HEADWITH
A
DECISION
WHICH
I
HAD
BUT
SELDOM
SEEN
IN
HIM
HE
SAID
OH
NO
OH
NO
I
WANT
NO
SOULS
LIFE
IS
ALL
I
WANT
HERE
HE
BRIGHTENEDUP
I
AM
PRETTY
INDIFFERENT
ABOUT
IT
AT
PRESENT
LIFE
IS
ALL
RIGHT
IHAVE
ALL
I
WANT
YOU
MUST
GET
A
NEW
PATIENT
DOCTOR
IF
YOU
WISH
TOSTUDY
ZOOPHAGY
THIS
PUZZLED
ME
A
LITTLE
SO
I
DREW
HIM
ON
THEN
YOU
COMMAND
LIFE
YOU
ARE
A
GOD
I
SUPPOSE
HE
SMILED
WITH
ANINEFFABLY
BENIGN
SUPERIORITY
OH
NO
FAR
BE
IT
FROM
ME
TO
ARROGATE
TO
MYSELF
THE
ATTRIBUTES
OF
THEDEITY
I
AM
NOT
EVEN
CONCERNED
IN
HIS
ESPECIALLY
SPIRITUAL
DOINGS
IF
IMAY
STATE
MY
INTELLECTUAL
POSITION
I
AM
SO
FAR
AS
CONCERNS
THINGSPURELY
TERRESTRIAL
SOMEWHAT
IN
THE
POSITION
WHICH
ENOCH
OCCUPIEDSPIRITUALLY
THIS
WAS
A
POSER
TO
ME
I
COULD
NOT
AT
THE
MOMENT
RECALLENOCH
S
APPOSITENESS
SO
I
HAD
TO
ASK
A
SIMPLE
QUESTION
THOUGH
I
FELTTHAT
BY
SO
DOING
I
WAS
LOWERING
MYSELF
IN
THE
EYES
OF
THE
LUNATIC
AND
WHY
WITH
ENOCH
BECAUSE
HE
WALKED
WITH
GOD
I
COULD
NOT
SEE
THE
ANALOGY
BUT
DID
NOTLIKE
TO
ADMIT
IT
SO
I
HARKED
BACK
TO
WHAT
HE
HAD
DENIED
SO
YOU
DON
T
CARE
ABOUT
LIFE
AND
YOU
DON
T
WANT
SOULS
WHY
NOT
I
PUTMY
QUESTION
QUICKLY
AND
SOMEWHAT
STERNLY
ON
PURPOSE
TO
DISCONCERT
HIM
THE
EFFORT
SUCCEEDED
FOR
AN
INSTANT
HE
UNCONSCIOUSLY
RELAPSED
INTO
HISOLD
SERVILE
MANNER
BENT
LOW
BEFORE
ME
AND
ACTUALLY
FAWNED
UPON
ME
ASHE
REPLIED
I
DON
T
WANT
ANY
SOULS
INDEED
INDEED
I
DON
T
I
COULDN
T
USE
THEM
IFI
HAD
THEM
THEY
WOULD
BE
NO
MANNER
OF
USE
TO
ME
I
COULDN
T
EAT
THEMOR
HE
SUDDENLY
STOPPED
AND
THE
OLD
CUNNING
LOOK
SPREAD
OVER
HISFACE
LIKE
A
WIND
SWEEP
ON
THE
SURFACE
OF
THE
WATER
AND
DOCTOR
AS
TOLIFE
WHAT
IS
IT
AFTER
ALL
WHEN
YOU
VE
GOT
ALL
YOU
REQUIRE
AND
YOUKNOW
THAT
YOU
WILL
NEVER
WANT
THAT
IS
ALL
I
HAVE
FRIENDS
GOODFRIENDS
LIKE
YOU
DR
SEWARD
THIS
WAS
SAID
WITH
A
LEER
OFINEXPRESSIBLE
CUNNING
I
KNOW
THAT
I
SHALL
NEVER
LACK
THE
MEANS
OFLIFE
I
THINK
THAT
THROUGH
THE
CLOUDINESS
OF
HIS
INSANITY
HE
SAW
SOMEANTAGONISM
IN
ME
FOR
HE
AT
ONCE
FELL
BACK
ON
THE
LAST
REFUGE
OF
SUCH
ASHE
A
DOGGED
SILENCE
AFTER
A
SHORT
TIME
I
SAW
THAT
FOR
THE
PRESENT
ITWAS
USELESS
TO
SPEAK
TO
HIM
HE
WAS
SULKY
AND
SO
I
CAME
AWAY
LATER
IN
THE
DAY
HE
SENT
FOR
ME
ORDINARILY
I
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
COMEWITHOUT
SPECIAL
REASON
BUT
JUST
AT
PRESENT
I
AM
SO
INTERESTED
IN
HIMTHAT
I
WOULD
GLADLY
MAKE
AN
EFFORT
BESIDES
I
AM
GLAD
TO
HAVE
ANYTHINGTO
HELP
TO
PASS
THE
TIME
HARKER
IS
OUT
FOLLOWING
UP
CLUES
AND
SO
ARELORD
GODALMING
AND
QUINCEY
VAN
HELSING
SITS
IN
MY
STUDY
PORING
OVER
THERECORD
PREPARED
BY
THE
HARKERS
HE
SEEMS
TO
THINK
THAT
BY
ACCURATEKNOWLEDGE
OF
ALL
DETAILS
HE
WILL
LIGHT
UPON
SOME
CLUE
HE
DOES
NOT
WISHTO
BE
DISTURBED
IN
THE
WORK
WITHOUT
CAUSE
I
WOULD
HAVE
TAKEN
HIM
WITHME
TO
SEE
THE
PATIENT
ONLY
I
THOUGHT
THAT
AFTER
HIS
LAST
REPULSE
HEMIGHT
NOT
CARE
TO
GO
AGAIN
THERE
WAS
ALSO
ANOTHER
REASON
RENFIELDMIGHT
NOT
SPEAK
SO
FREELY
BEFORE
A
THIRD
PERSON
AS
WHEN
HE
AND
I
WEREALONE
I
FOUND
HIM
SITTING
OUT
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
FLOOR
ON
HIS
STOOL
A
POSEWHICH
IS
GENERALLY
INDICATIVE
OF
SOME
MENTAL
ENERGY
ON
HIS
PART
WHEN
ICAME
IN
HE
SAID
AT
ONCE
AS
THOUGH
THE
QUESTION
HAD
BEEN
WAITING
ON
HISLIPS
WHAT
ABOUT
SOULS
IT
WAS
EVIDENT
THEN
THAT
MY
SURMISE
HAD
BEENCORRECT
UNCONSCIOUS
CEREBRATION
WAS
DOING
ITS
WORK
EVEN
WITH
THELUNATIC
I
DETERMINED
TO
HAVE
THE
MATTER
OUT
WHAT
ABOUT
THEMYOURSELF
I
ASKED
HE
DID
NOT
REPLY
FOR
A
MOMENT
BUT
LOOKED
ALL
ROUNDHIM
AND
UP
AND
DOWN
AS
THOUGH
HE
EXPECTED
TO
FIND
SOME
INSPIRATION
FORAN
ANSWER
I
DON
T
WANT
ANY
SOULS
HE
SAID
IN
A
FEEBLE
APOLOGETIC
WAY
THEMATTER
SEEMED
PREYING
ON
HIS
MIND
AND
SO
I
DETERMINED
TO
USE
IT
TO
BECRUEL
ONLY
TO
BE
KIND
SO
I
SAID
YOU
LIKE
LIFE
AND
YOU
WANT
LIFE
OH
YES
BUT
THAT
IS
ALL
RIGHT
YOU
NEEDN
T
WORRY
ABOUT
THAT
BUT
I
ASKED
HOW
ARE
WE
TO
GET
THE
LIFE
WITHOUT
GETTING
THE
SOULALSO
THIS
SEEMED
TO
PUZZLE
HIM
SO
I
FOLLOWED
IT
UP
A
NICE
TIME
YOU
LL
HAVE
SOME
TIME
WHEN
YOU
RE
FLYING
OUT
THERE
WITHTHE
SOULS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
FLIES
AND
SPIDERS
AND
BIRDS
AND
CATS
BUZZINGAND
TWITTERING
AND
MIAUING
ALL
ROUND
YOU
YOU
VE
GOT
THEIR
LIVES
YOUKNOW
AND
YOU
MUST
PUT
UP
WITH
THEIR
SOULS
SOMETHING
SEEMED
TO
AFFECTHIS
IMAGINATION
FOR
HE
PUT
HIS
FINGERS
TO
HIS
EARS
AND
SHUT
HIS
EYES
SCREWING
THEM
UP
TIGHTLY
JUST
AS
A
SMALL
BOY
DOES
WHEN
HIS
FACE
IS
BEINGSOAPED
THERE
WAS
SOMETHING
PATHETIC
IN
IT
THAT
TOUCHED
ME
IT
ALSO
GAVEME
A
LESSON
FOR
IT
SEEMED
THAT
BEFORE
ME
WAS
A
CHILD
ONLY
A
CHILD
THOUGH
THE
FEATURES
WERE
WORN
AND
THE
STUBBLE
ON
THE
JAWS
WAS
WHITE
ITWAS
EVIDENT
THAT
HE
WAS
UNDERGOING
SOME
PROCESS
OF
MENTAL
DISTURBANCE
AND
KNOWING
HOW
HIS
PAST
MOODS
HAD
INTERPRETED
THINGS
SEEMINGLY
FOREIGNTO
HIMSELF
I
THOUGHT
I
WOULD
ENTER
INTO
HIS
MIND
AS
WELL
AS
I
COULD
ANDGO
WITH
HIM
THE
FIRST
STEP
WAS
TO
RESTORE
CONFIDENCE
SO
I
ASKED
HIM
SPEAKING
PRETTY
LOUD
SO
THAT
HE
WOULD
HEAR
ME
THROUGH
HIS
CLOSED
EARS
WOULD
YOU
LIKE
SOME
SUGAR
TO
GET
YOUR
FLIES
ROUND
AGAIN
HE
SEEMED
TOWAKE
UP
ALL
AT
ONCE
AND
SHOOK
HIS
HEAD
WITH
A
LAUGH
HE
REPLIED
NOT
MUCH
FLIES
ARE
POOR
THINGS
AFTER
ALL
AFTER
A
PAUSE
HE
ADDED
BUT
I
DON
T
WANT
THEIR
SOULS
BUZZING
ROUND
ME
ALL
THE
SAME
OR
SPIDERS
I
WENT
ON
BLOW
SPIDERS
WHAT
S
THE
USE
OF
SPIDERS
THERE
ISN
T
ANYTHING
IN
THEMTO
EAT
OR
HE
STOPPED
SUDDENLY
AS
THOUGH
REMINDED
OF
A
FORBIDDENTOPIC
SO
SO
I
THOUGHT
TO
MYSELF
THIS
IS
THE
SECOND
TIME
HE
HAS
SUDDENLYSTOPPED
AT
THE
WORD
DRINK
WHAT
DOES
IT
MEAN
RENFIELD
SEEMED
HIMSELFAWARE
OF
HAVING
MADE
A
LAPSE
FOR
HE
HURRIED
ON
AS
THOUGH
TO
DISTRACTMY
ATTENTION
FROM
IT
I
DON
T
TAKE
ANY
STOCK
AT
ALL
IN
SUCH
MATTERS
RATS
AND
MICE
AND
SUCHSMALL
DEER
AS
SHAKESPEARE
HAS
IT
CHICKEN
FEED
OF
THE
LARDER
THEYMIGHT
BE
CALLED
I
M
PAST
ALL
THAT
SORT
OF
NONSENSE
YOU
MIGHT
AS
WELLASK
A
MAN
TO
EAT
MOLECULES
WITH
A
PAIR
OF
CHOP
STICKS
AS
TO
TRY
TOINTEREST
ME
ABOUT
THE
LESSER
CARNIVORA
WHEN
I
KNOW
OF
WHAT
IS
BEFOREME
I
SEE
I
SAID
YOU
WANT
BIG
THINGS
THAT
YOU
CAN
MAKE
YOUR
TEETH
MEETIN
HOW
WOULD
YOU
LIKE
TO
BREAKFAST
ON
ELEPHANT
WHAT
RIDICULOUS
NONSENSE
YOU
ARE
TALKING
HE
WAS
GETTING
TOO
WIDEAWAKE
SO
I
THOUGHT
I
WOULD
PRESS
HIM
HARD
I
WONDER
I
SAIDREFLECTIVELY
WHAT
AN
ELEPHANT
S
SOUL
IS
LIKE
THE
EFFECT
I
DESIRED
WAS
OBTAINED
FOR
HE
AT
ONCE
FELL
FROM
HISHIGH
HORSE
AND
BECAME
A
CHILD
AGAIN
I
DON
T
WANT
AN
ELEPHANT
S
SOUL
OR
ANY
SOUL
AT
ALL
HE
SAID
FOR
AFEW
MOMENTS
HE
SAT
DESPONDENTLY
SUDDENLY
HE
JUMPED
TO
HIS
FEET
WITHHIS
EYES
BLAZING
AND
ALL
THE
SIGNS
OF
INTENSE
CEREBRAL
EXCITEMENT
TOHELL
WITH
YOU
AND
YOUR
SOULS
HE
SHOUTED
WHY
DO
YOU
PLAGUE
ME
ABOUTSOULS
HAVEN
T
I
GOT
ENOUGH
TO
WORRY
AND
PAIN
AND
DISTRACT
ME
ALREADY
WITHOUT
THINKING
OF
SOULS
HE
LOOKED
SO
HOSTILE
THAT
I
THOUGHT
HE
WASIN
FOR
ANOTHER
HOMICIDAL
FIT
SO
I
BLEW
MY
WHISTLE
THE
INSTANT
HOWEVER
THAT
I
DID
SO
HE
BECAME
CALM
AND
SAID
APOLOGETICALLY
FORGIVE
ME
DOCTOR
I
FORGOT
MYSELF
YOU
DO
NOT
NEED
ANY
HELP
I
AM
SOWORRIED
IN
MY
MIND
THAT
I
AM
APT
TO
BE
IRRITABLE
IF
YOU
ONLY
KNEW
THEPROBLEM
I
HAVE
TO
FACE
AND
THAT
I
AM
WORKING
OUT
YOU
WOULD
PITY
ANDTOLERATE
AND
PARDON
ME
PRAY
DO
NOT
PUT
ME
IN
A
STRAIT
WAISTCOAT
IWANT
TO
THINK
AND
I
CANNOT
THINK
FREELY
WHEN
MY
BODY
IS
CONFINED
I
AMSURE
YOU
WILL
UNDERSTAND
HE
HAD
EVIDENTLY
SELF
CONTROL
SO
WHEN
THEATTENDANTS
CAME
I
TOLD
THEM
NOT
TO
MIND
AND
THEY
WITHDREW
RENFIELDWATCHED
THEM
GO
WHEN
THE
DOOR
WAS
CLOSED
HE
SAID
WITH
CONSIDERABLEDIGNITY
AND
SWEETNESS
DR
SEWARD
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
VERY
CONSIDERATE
TOWARDS
ME
BELIEVE
ME
THATI
AM
VERY
VERY
GRATEFUL
TO
YOU
I
THOUGHT
IT
WELL
TO
LEAVE
HIM
IN
THISMOOD
AND
SO
I
CAME
AWAY
THERE
IS
CERTAINLY
SOMETHING
TO
PONDER
OVER
INTHIS
MAN
S
STATE
SEVERAL
POINTS
SEEM
TO
MAKE
WHAT
THE
AMERICANINTERVIEWER
CALLS
A
STORY
IF
ONE
COULD
ONLY
GET
THEM
IN
PROPER
ORDER
HERE
THEY
ARE
WILL
NOT
MENTION

FEARS
THE
THOUGHT
OF
BEING
BURDENED
WITH
THE
SOUL
OF
ANYTHING
HAS
NO
DREAD
OF
WANTING
LIFE
IN
THE
FUTURE
DESPISES
THE
MEANER
FORMS
OF
LIFE
ALTOGETHER
THOUGH
HE
DREADS
BEINGHAUNTED
BY
THEIR
SOULS
LOGICALLY
ALL
THESE
THINGS
POINT
ONE
WAY
HE
HAS
ASSURANCE
OF
SOME
KINDTHAT
HE
WILL
ACQUIRE
SOME
HIGHER
LIFE
HE
DREADS
THE
CONSEQUENCE
THEBURDEN
OF
A

THEN
IT
IS
A
HUMAN

HE
LOOKS
TO
AND
THE
ASSURANCE

OF

CURES
WHICH
MAY

I
SOMETIMES
THINK
WE

SUBTLE
WAY
IF

COULD

GETSOME
HINT
AS
TO
WHAT
PASSED
IN
HIS

BETWEEN

AND
HIS

OF

MIGHT
AFFORD

AVALUABLE
CLUE
HE
IS
NOW
SEEMINGLY
QUIET
FOR
A
SPELL
IS
HE
THATWILD
YELL
SEEMED
TO
COME
FROM
HIS
ROOM
THE
ATTENDANT
CAME
BURSTING
INTO
MY
ROOM
AND
TOLD
ME
THAT
RENFIELD
HADSOMEHOW
MET
WITH
SOME
ACCIDENT
HE
HAD
HEARD
HIM
YELL
AND
WHEN
HE
WENTTO
HIM
FOUND
HIM
LYING
ON
HIS
FACE
ON
THE
FLOOR
ALL
COVERED
WITH
BLOOD
I
MUST
GO
AT

CHAPTER
XXIDR
SEWARD
S
DIARY
OCTOBER
LET
ME
PUT
DOWN
WITH
EXACTNESS
ALL
THAT
HAPPENED
AS
WELLAS
I
CAN
REMEMBER
IT
SINCE
LAST
I
MADE
AN
ENTRY
NOT
A
DETAIL
THAT
ICAN
RECALL
MUST
BE
FORGOTTEN
IN
ALL
CALMNESS
I
MUST
PROCEED
WHEN
I
CAME
TO
RENFIELD
S
ROOM
I
FOUND
HIM
LYING
ON
THE
FLOOR
ON
HISLEFT
SIDE
IN
A
GLITTERING
POOL
OF
BLOOD
WHEN
I
WENT
TO
MOVE
HIM
ITBECAME
AT
ONCE
APPARENT
THAT
HE
HAD
RECEIVED
SOME
TERRIBLE
INJURIES
THERE
SEEMED
NONE
OF
THAT
UNITY
OF
PURPOSE
BETWEEN
THE
PARTS
OF
THE
BODYWHICH
MARKS
EVEN
LETHARGIC
SANITY
AS
THE
FACE
WAS
EXPOSED
I
COULD
SEETHAT
IT
WAS
HORRIBLY
BRUISED
AS
THOUGH
IT
HAD
BEEN
BEATEN
AGAINST
THEFLOOR
INDEED
IT
WAS
FROM
THE
FACE
WOUNDS
THAT
THE
POOL
OF
BLOODORIGINATED
THE
ATTENDANT
WHO
WAS
KNEELING
BESIDE
THE
BODY
SAID
TO
ME
ASWE
TURNED
HIM
OVER
I
THINK
SIR
HIS
BACK
IS
BROKEN
SEE
BOTH
HIS
RIGHT
ARM
AND
LEG
ANDTHE
WHOLE
SIDE
OF
HIS
FACE
ARE
PARALYSED
HOW
SUCH
A
THING
COULD
HAVEHAPPENED
PUZZLED
THE
ATTENDANT
BEYOND
MEASURE
HE
SEEMED
QUITEBEWILDERED
AND
HIS
BROWS
WERE
GATHERED
IN
AS
HE
SAID
I
CAN
T
UNDERSTAND
THE
TWO
THINGS
HE
COULD
MARK
HIS
FACE
LIKE
THAT
BYBEATING
HIS
OWN
HEAD
ON
THE
FLOOR
I
SAW
A
YOUNG
WOMAN
DO
IT
ONCE
AT
THEEVERSFIELD
ASYLUM
BEFORE
ANYONE
COULD
LAY
HANDS
ON
HER
AND
I
SUPPOSE
HEMIGHT
HAVE
BROKE
HIS
NECK
BY
FALLING
OUT
OF
BED
IF
HE
GOT
IN
AN
AWKWARDKINK
BUT
FOR
THE
LIFE
OF
ME
I
CAN
T
IMAGINE
HOW
THE
TWO
THINGSOCCURRED
IF
HIS
BACK
WAS
BROKE
HE
COULDN
T
BEAT
HIS
HEAD
AND
IF
HISFACE
WAS
LIKE
THAT
BEFORE
THE
FALL
OUT
OF
BED
THERE
WOULD
BE
MARKS
OFIT
I
SAID
TO
HIM
GO
TO
DR
VAN
HELSING
AND
ASK
HIM
TO
KINDLY
COME
HERE
AT
ONCE
I
WANTHIM
WITHOUT
AN
INSTANT
S
DELAY
THE
MAN
RAN
OFF
AND
WITHIN
A
FEWMINUTES
THE
PROFESSOR
IN
HIS
DRESSING
GOWN
AND
SLIPPERS
APPEARED
WHENHE
SAW
RENFIELD
ON
THE
GROUND
HE
LOOKED
KEENLY
AT
HIM
A
MOMENT
ANDTHEN
TURNED
TO
ME
I
THINK
HE
RECOGNISED
MY
THOUGHT
IN
MY
EYES
FOR
HESAID
VERY
QUIETLY
MANIFESTLY
FOR
THE
EARS
OF
THE
ATTENDANT
AH
A
SAD
ACCIDENT
HE
WILL
NEED
VERY
CAREFUL
WATCHING
AND
MUCHATTENTION
I
SHALL
STAY
WITH
YOU
MYSELF
BUT
I
SHALL
FIRST
DRESS
MYSELF
IF
YOU
WILL
REMAIN
I
SHALL
IN
A
FEW
MINUTES
JOIN
YOU
THE
PATIENT
WAS
NOW
BREATHING
STERTOROUSLY
AND
IT
WAS
EASY
TO
SEE
THATHE
HAD
SUFFERED
SOME
TERRIBLE
INJURY
VAN
HELSING
RETURNED
WITHEXTRAORDINARY
CELERITY
BEARING
WITH
HIM
A
SURGICAL
CASE
HE
HADEVIDENTLY
BEEN
THINKING
AND
HAD
HIS
MIND
MADE
UP
FOR
ALMOST
BEFORE
HELOOKED
AT
THE
PATIENT
HE
WHISPERED
TO
ME
SEND
THE
ATTENDANT
AWAY
WE
MUST
BE
ALONE
WITH
HIM
WHEN
HE
BECOMESCONSCIOUS
AFTER
THE
OPERATION
SO
I
SAID
I
THINK
THAT
WILL
DO
NOW
SIMMONS
WE
HAVE
DONE
ALL
THAT
WE
CAN
ATPRESENT
YOU
HAD
BETTER
GO
YOUR
ROUND
AND
DR
VAN
HELSING
WILL
OPERATE
LET
ME
KNOW
INSTANTLY
IF
THERE
BE
ANYTHING
UNUSUAL
ANYWHERE
THE
MAN
WITHDREW
AND
WE
WENT
INTO
A
STRICT
EXAMINATION
OF
THE
PATIENT
THE
WOUNDS
OF
THE
FACE
WAS
SUPERFICIAL
THE
REAL
INJURY
WAS
A
DEPRESSEDFRACTURE
OF
THE
SKULL
EXTENDING
RIGHT
UP
THROUGH
THE
MOTOR
AREA
THEPROFESSOR
THOUGHT
A
MOMENT
AND
SAID
WE
MUST
REDUCE
THE
PRESSURE
AND
GET
BACK
TO
NORMAL
CONDITIONS
AS
FARAS
CAN
BE
THE
RAPIDITY
OF
THE
SUFFUSION
SHOWS
THE
TERRIBLE
NATURE
OFHIS
INJURY
THE
WHOLE
MOTOR
AREA
SEEMS
AFFECTED
THE
SUFFUSION
OF
THEBRAIN
WILL
INCREASE
QUICKLY
SO
WE
MUST
TREPHINE
AT
ONCE
OR
IT
MAY
BETOO
LATE
AS
HE
WAS
SPEAKING
THERE
WAS
A
SOFT
TAPPING
AT
THE
DOOR
IWENT
OVER
AND
OPENED
IT
AND
FOUND
IN
THE
CORRIDOR
WITHOUT
ARTHUR
ANDQUINCEY
IN
PAJAMAS
AND
SLIPPERS
THE
FORMER
SPOKE
I
HEARD
YOUR
MAN
CALL
UP
DR
VAN
HELSING
AND
TELL
HIM
OF
AN
ACCIDENT
SO
I
WOKE
QUINCEY
OR

FOR
HIM
AS
HE
WAS
NOT

THINGSARE
MOVING
TOO
QUICKLY
AND
TOO
STRANGELY
FOR

SLEEP
FOR
ANY
OF
USTHESE

WE
LL
HAVE
TO
LOOK
BACK
AND
FORWARD
A

MAY

NODDED
AND
HELD
THE

THEN
I
CLOSED
IT
AGAIN
WHEN
QUINCEY
SAW
THEATTITUDE
AND
STATE
OF
THE
PATIENT
AND
NOTED
THE
HORRIBLE
POOL
ON
THEFLOOR
HE
SAID
SOFTLY
MY
GOD
WHAT
HAS
HAPPENED
TO
HIM
POOR
POOR
DEVIL
I
TOLD
HIMBRIEFLY
AND
ADDED
THAT
WE
EXPECTED
HE
WOULD
RECOVER
CONSCIOUSNESS
AFTERTHE
OPERATION
FOR
A
SHORT
TIME
AT
ALL
EVENTS
HE
WENT
AT
ONCE
AND
SATDOWN
ON
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
BED
WITH
GODALMING
BESIDE
HIM
WE
ALL
WATCHEDIN
PATIENCE
WE
SHALL
WAIT
SAID
VAN
HELSING
JUST
LONG
ENOUGH
TO
FIX
THE
BESTSPOT
FOR
TREPHINING
SO
THAT
WE
MAY
MOST
QUICKLY
AND
PERFECTLY
REMOVETHE
BLOOD
CLOT
FOR
IT
IS
EVIDENT
THAT
THE
HAEMORRHAGE
IS
INCREASING
THE
MINUTES
DURING
WHICH
WE
WAITED
PASSED
WITH
FEARFUL
SLOWNESS
I
HAD
AHORRIBLE
SINKING
IN
MY
HEART
AND
FROM
VAN
HELSING
S
FACE
I
GATHEREDTHAT
HE
FELT
SOME
FEAR
OR
APPREHENSION
AS
TO
WHAT
WAS
TO
COME
I
DREADEDTHE
WORDS
THAT
RENFIELD
MIGHT
SPEAK
I
WAS
POSITIVELY
AFRAID
TO
THINK
BUT
THE
CONVICTION
OF
WHAT
WAS
COMING
WAS
ON
ME
AS
I
HAVE
READ
OF
MENWHO
HAVE
HEARD
THE
DEATH
WATCH
THE
POOR
MAN
S
BREATHING
CAME
INUNCERTAIN
GASPS
EACH
INSTANT
HE
SEEMED
AS
THOUGH
HE
WOULD
OPEN
HIS
EYESAND
SPEAK
BUT
THEN
WOULD
FOLLOW
A
PROLONGED
STERTOROUS
BREATH
AND
HEWOULD
RELAPSE
INTO
A
MORE
FIXED
INSENSIBILITY
INURED
AS
I
WAS
TO
SICKBEDS
AND
DEATH
THIS
SUSPENSE
GREW
AND
GREW
UPON
ME
I
COULD
ALMOSTHEAR
THE
BEATING
OF
MY
OWN
HEART
AND
THE
BLOOD
SURGING
THROUGH
MYTEMPLES
SOUNDED
LIKE
BLOWS
FROM
A
HAMMER
THE
SILENCE
FINALLY
BECAMEAGONISING
I
LOOKED
AT
MY
COMPANIONS
ONE
AFTER
ANOTHER
AND
SAW
FROMTHEIR
FLUSHED
FACES
AND
DAMP
BROWS
THAT
THEY
WERE
ENDURING
EQUALTORTURE
THERE
WAS
A
NERVOUS
SUSPENSE
OVER
US
ALL
AS
THOUGH
OVERHEADSOME
DREAD
BELL
WOULD
PEAL
OUT
POWERFULLY
WHEN
WE
SHOULD
LEAST
EXPECTIT
AT
LAST
THERE
CAME
A
TIME
WHEN
IT
WAS
EVIDENT
THAT
THE
PATIENT
WASSINKING
FAST
HE
MIGHT
DIE
AT
ANY
MOMENT
I
LOOKED
UP
AT
THE
PROFESSORAND
CAUGHT
HIS
EYES
FIXED
ON
MINE
HIS

WAS
STERNLY
SET
AS
HESPOKE
THERE
IS
NO
TIME
TO
LOSE
HIS
WORDS
MAY
BE
WORTH
MANY
LIVES
I
HAVEBEEN
THINKING
SO
AS
I
STOOD
HERE
IT
MAY
BE
THERE
IS
A
SOUL
AT
STAKE
WE
SHALL
OPERATE
JUST
ABOVE
THE
EAR
WITHOUT
ANOTHER
WORD
HE
MADE
THE
OPERATION
FOR
A
FEW
MOMENTS
THEBREATHING
CONTINUED
TO
BE
STERTOROUS
THEN
THERE
CAME
A
BREATH
SOPROLONGED
THAT
IT
SEEMED
AS
THOUGH
IT
WOULD
TEAR
OPEN
HIS
CHEST
SUDDENLY
HIS
EYES
OPENED
AND
BECAME
FIXED
IN
A
WILD
HELPLESS
STARE
THIS
WAS
CONTINUED
FOR
A
FEW
MOMENTS
THEN
IT
SOFTENED
INTO
A
GLADSURPRISE
AND
FROM
THE
LIPS
CAME
A
SIGH
OF
RELIEF
HE
MOVEDCONVULSIVELY
AND
AS
HE
DID
SO
SAID
I
LL
BE
QUIET
DOCTOR
TELL
THEM
TO
TAKE
OFF
THE
STRAIT
WAISTCOAT
IHAVE
HAD
A
TERRIBLE
DREAM
AND
IT
HAS
LEFT

SO
WEAK
THAT
I
CANNOTMOVE
WHAT
S
WRONG
WITH
MY

IT
FEELS
ALL
SWOLLEN
AND
IT
SMARTSDREADFULLY
HE
TRIED
TO
TURN
HIS
HEAD
BUT
EVEN
WITH
THE
EFFORT
HISEYES
SEEMED
TO
GROW
GLASSY
AGAIN
SO
I
GENTLY
PUT
IT
BACK
THEN
VANHELSING
SAID
IN
A
QUIET
GRAVE
TONE
TELL
US
YOUR
DREAM
MR
RENFIELD
AS
HE
HEARD
THE
VOICE
HIS

THROUGH

FLEW
AND
RETURNED
WITH
A
GLASS
THE
DECANTER
OF
BRANDY
AND
A
CARAFE
OF
WATER
WE
MOISTENED
THE
PARCHEDLIPS
AND
THE
PATIENT
QUICKLY
REVIVED
IT
SEEMED
HOWEVER
THAT
HIS
POORINJURED
BRAIN
HAD
BEEN
WORKING
IN
THE
INTERVAL
FOR
WHEN
HE
WAS
QUITECONSCIOUS
HE
LOOKED
AT
ME
PIERCINGLY
WITH
AN
AGONISED
CONFUSION
WHICH
ISHALL
NEVER
FORGET
AND
SAID
I
MUST
NOT
DECEIVE
MYSELF
IT
WAS
NO
DREAM
BUT
ALL
A
GRIM
REALITY
THEN
HIS
EYES
ROVED
ROUND
THE
ROOM
AS
THEY
CAUGHT
SIGHT
OF
THE
TWOFIGURES
SITTING
PATIENTLY
ON
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
BED
HE
WENT
ON
IF
I
WERE
NOT
SURE
ALREADY
I
WOULD
KNOW
FROM
THEM
FOR
AN
INSTANT
HISEYES
CLOSED
NOT
WITH
PAIN
OR

BUT
VOLUNTARILY
AS

HE
WEREBRINGING
ALL
HIS
FACULTIES

SAID
HURRIEDLY
AND
WITH
MORE
ENERGY
THAN

DISPLAYED
QUICK
DOCTOR
QUICK
I
AM
DYING

I
HAVE
SOMETHING
THAT
I
MUST

IN
AN
AGONY
OF

THEN
THERE
CAME
A
SUDDEN
PEACE

AND
I
REALISED
WHERE

HOWEVER
BETRAY
HIMSELF

NODDED
SLIGHTLYAND
SAID
GO
ON
IN
A
LOW
VOICE
RENFIELD
PROCEEDED
HE
CAME
UP
TO
THE
WINDOW
IN
THE
MIST
AS
I
HAD
SEEN
HIM
OFTEN
BEFORE
BUT
HE
WAS
SOLID
THEN
NOT
A
GHOST
AND
HIS
EYES
WERE
FIERCE
LIKE
AMAN
S
WHEN
ANGRY
HE
WAS
LAUGHING
WITH
HIS
RED
MOUTH
THE
SHARP
WHITETEETH
GLINTED
IN
THE
MOONLIGHT
WHEN
HE
TURNED
TO
LOOK
BACK
OVER
THE
BELTOF
TREES
TO
WHERE
THE
DOGS
WERE
BARKING
I
WOULDN
T
ASK
HIM
TO
COME
INAT
FIRST
THOUGH
I
KNEW
HE
WANTED
TO
JUST
AS
HE
HAD
WANTED
ALL
ALONG
THEN
HE
BEGAN
PROMISING
ME
THINGS
NOT
IN
WORDS
BUT
BY
DOING
THEM
HEWAS
INTERRUPTED
BY
A
WORD
FROM
THE
PROFESSOR
HOW
BY
MAKING
THEM
HAPPEN
JUST
AS
HE
USED
TO
SEND
IN
THE
FLIES
WHEN
THESUN
WAS
SHINING
GREAT
BIG
FAT
ONES
WITH
STEEL
AND
SAPPHIRE
ON
THEIRWINGS
AND
BIG
MOTHS
IN
THE
NIGHT
WITH
SKULL
AND
CROSS
BONES
ON
THEIRBACKS
VAN
HELSING
NODDED
TO
HIM
AS
HE
WHISPERED
TO
ME
UNCONSCIOUSLY
THE
ACHERONTIA
AITETROPOS
OF
THE
SPHINGES
WHAT
YOU
CALL
THE
DEATH
S
HEAD
MOTH
THE
PATIENT
WENT
ON
WITHOUT
STOPPING
THEN
HE
BEGAN
TO
WHISPER
RATS
RATS
RATS
HUNDREDS
THOUSANDS
MILLIONS
OF
THEM
AND
EVERY
ONE
A
LIFE
AND
DOGS
TO
EAT
THEM
AND
CATSTOO
ALL
LIVES
ALL
RED
BLOOD
WITH
YEARS
OF
LIFE
IN
IT
AND
NOT
MERELYBUZZING
FLIES
I
LAUGHED
AT
HIM
FOR
I
WANTED
TO
SEE
WHAT
HE
COULD
DO
THEN
THE
DOGS
HOWLED
AWAY
BEYOND
THE
DARK
TREES
IN
HIS
HOUSE
HEBECKONED
ME
TO
THE
WINDOW
I
GOT
UP
AND
LOOKED
OUT
AND
HE
RAISED
HISHANDS
AND
SEEMED
TO
CALL
OUT
WITHOUT
USING
ANY
WORDS
A
DARK
MASSSPREAD
OVER
THE
GRASS
COMING
ON
LIKE
THE
SHAPE
OF
A
FLAME
OF
FIRE
ANDTHEN
HE
MOVED
THE
MIST
TO
THE
RIGHT
AND
LEFT
AND
I
COULD
SEE
THAT
THEREWERE
THOUSANDS
OF
RATS
WITH
THEIR
EYES
BLAZING
RED
LIKE
HIS
ONLYSMALLER
HE
HELD
UP
HIS
HAND
AND
THEY
ALL
STOPPED
AND
I
THOUGHT
HESEEMED
TO
BE
SAYING
ALL
THESE
LIVES
WILL
I
GIVE
YOU
AY
AND
MANY
MOREAND
GREATER
THROUGH
COUNTLESS
AGES
IF
YOU
WILL
FALL
DOWN
AND
WORSHIPME
AND
THEN
A
RED
CLOUD
LIKE
THE
COLOUR
OF
BLOOD
SEEMED
TO
CLOSEOVER
MY
EYES
AND
BEFORE
I
KNEW
WHAT
I
WAS
DOING
I
FOUND
MYSELF
OPENINGTHE
SASH
AND
SAYING
TO
HIM
COME
IN
LORD
AND
MASTER
THE
RATS
WEREALL
GONE
BUT
HE
SLID
INTO
THE
ROOM
THROUGH
THE
SASH
THOUGH
IT
WAS
ONLYOPEN
AN
INCH
WIDE
JUST
AS
THE
MOON
HERSELF
HAS
OFTEN
COME
IN
THROUGHTHE
TINIEST
CRACK
AND
HAS
STOOD
BEFORE
ME
IN
ALL
HER
SIZE
ANDSPLENDOUR
HIS
VOICE
WAS
WEAKER
SO
I
MOISTENED
HIS
LIPS
WITH
THE
BRANDY
AGAIN
ANDHE
CONTINUED
BUT
IT
SEEMED
AS
THOUGH
HIS
MEMORY
HAD
GONE
ON
WORKING
INTHE
INTERVAL
FOR
HIS
STORY
WAS
FURTHER
ADVANCED
I
WAS
ABOUT
TO
CALL
HIMBACK
TO
THE
POINT
BUT
VAN
HELSING
WHISPERED
TO
ME
LET
HIM
GO
ON
DONOT
INTERRUPT
HIM
HE
CANNOT
GO
BACK
AND
MAYBE
COULD
NOT
PROCEED
AT
ALLIF
ONCE
HE
LOST
THE
THREAD
OF
HIS
THOUGHT
HE
PROCEEDED
ALL
DAY
I
WAITED
TO
HEAR
FROM
HIM
BUT
HE
DID
NOT
SEND
ME
ANYTHING
NOTEVEN
A
BLOW
FLY
AND
WHEN
THE
MOON
GOT
UP
I
WAS
PRETTY
ANGRY
WITH
HIM
WHEN
HE
SLID
IN
THROUGH
THE
WINDOW
THOUGH
IT
WAS
SHUT
AND
DID
NOT
EVENKNOCK
I
GOT
MAD
WITH
HIM
HE
SNEERED
AT
ME
AND
HIS
WHITE
FACE
LOOKEDOUT
OF
THE
MIST
WITH
HIS
RED
EYES
GLEAMING
AND
HE
WENT
ON
AS
THOUGH
HEOWNED
THE
WHOLE

WERE
BOTH
SILENT
BUT
THE
PROFESSOR
STARTED
AND
QUIVERED
HIS

HOWEVER
GREW
GRIMMER
AND
STERNER
STILL
RENFIELD
WENT

FOR
HE
LAY
BY
MY
SIDE
WHENNEXT
I
REMEMBER
THERE
WAS
IN
THE

THE

THIN
WHITE
MIST
THAT
IHAD
BEFORE
NOTICED

YOU
WILL
FINDIT
IN

I
SHALL
SHOW

LATER
I
FELT
THE

VAGUETERROR
WHICH
HAD
COME
TO

BEFORE
AND
THE
SAME
SENSE
OF
SOME
PRESENCE

TURNED
TO
WAKE
JONATHAN
BUT
FOUND
THAT
HE
SLEPT
SO
SOUNDLY
THAT
ITSEEMED
AS
IF
IT
WAS
HE
WHO
HAD
TAKEN
THE
SLEEPING
DRAUGHT
AND
NOT
I
ITRIED
BUT
I
COULD
NOT
WAKE
HIM
THIS
CAUSED
ME
A
GREAT
FEAR
AND
ILOOKED
AROUND
TERRIFIED
THEN
INDEED
MY
HEART
SANK
WITHIN
ME
BESIDETHE
BED
AS
IF
HE
HAD
STEPPED
OUT
OF
THE
MIST
OR
RATHER
AS
IF
THE
MISTHAD
TURNED
INTO
HIS
FIGURE
FOR
IT
HAD
ENTIRELY
DISAPPEARED
STOOD
ATALL
THIN
MAN
ALL
IN

KNEW
HIM
AT

FROM
THE

WHERE
JONATHAN
HAD
STRUCK
HIM
FOR
AN
INSTANTMY
HEART
STOOD
STILL
AND
I
WOULD
HAVE
SCREAMED
OUT
ONLY
THAT
I
WASPARALYSED
IN
THE

SPOKE
IN
A
SORT
OF
KEEN
CUTTING
WHISPER
POINTING
AS

IF
YOU
MAKE
A

I
SHALL
TAKE

OUTBEFORE

WAS
APPALLED

UPON
MY

OF
THE

CURSE
THATSUCH
IS
WHEN

OFDESPAIR
THERE
MUST
BE
NO

NOTHING
IN
ALL
THE

THAT
CANGIVE

MORE

HAVE
ALREADY
ENDURED

THAT
WE

USETHEM
AS
OF
OLD
WE
ARE
NOW
SO
MUCH
FURTHER
ADVANCED
IN
OUR
KNOWLEDGE
ASTO
THEIR
DISPOSITION
THAT
WHEN
WE
HAVE
EXAMINED
THE
HOUSE
INPICCADILLY
WE
MAY
TRACK
THE
VERY
LAST
OF
THEM
TO
DAY
THEN
IS
OURS
AND
IN
IT
RESTS
OUR
HOPE
THE
SUN
THAT
ROSE
ON
OUR
SORROW
THIS
MORNINGGUARDS
US
IN
ITS
COURSE
UNTIL
IT
SETS
TO
NIGHT
THAT
MONSTER
MUSTRETAIN
WHATEVER
FORM
HE
NOW
HAS
HE
IS
CONFINED
WITHIN
THE
LIMITATIONSOF
HIS
EARTHLY
ENVELOPE
HE
CANNOT
MELT
INTO
THIN
AIR
NOR
DISAPPEARTHROUGH
CRACKS
OR
CHINKS
OR
CRANNIES
IF
HE
GO
THROUGH
A
DOORWAY
HEMUST
OPEN
THE
DOOR
LIKE
A
MORTAL
AND
SO
WE
HAVE
THIS
DAY
TO
HUNT
OUTALL
HIS
LAIRS
AND
STERILISE
THEM
SO
WE
SHALL
IF
WE
HAVE
NOT
YET
CATCHHIM
AND
DESTROY
HIM
DRIVE
HIM
TO
BAY
IN
SOME
PLACE
WHERE
THE
CATCHINGAND
THE
DESTROYING
SHALL
BE
IN
TIME
SURE
HERE
I
STARTED
UP
FOR
ICOULD
NOT
CONTAIN
MYSELF
AT
THE
THOUGHT
THAT
THE
MINUTES
AND
SECONDS
SOPRECIOUSLY
LADEN
WITH
MINA
S
LIFE
AND
HAPPINESS
WERE
FLYING
FROM
US
SINCE
WHILST
WE
TALKED
ACTION
WAS
IMPOSSIBLE
BUT
VAN
HELSING
HELD
UPHIS
HAND
WARNINGLY
NAY
FRIEND
JONATHAN
HE
SAID
IN
THIS
THEQUICKEST
WAY
HOME
IS
THE
LONGEST
WAY
SO
YOUR
PROVERB
SAY
WE
SHALL
ALLACT
AND
ACT
WITH
DESPERATE
QUICK
WHEN
THE
TIME
HAS
COME
BUT
THINK
INALL
PROBABLE
THE
KEY
OF
THE
SITUATION
IS
IN
THAT
HOUSE
IN
PICCADILLY
THE
COUNT
MAY
HAVE
MANY
HOUSES
WHICH
HE
HAS
BOUGHT
OF
THEM
HE
WILL
HAVEDEEDS
OF
PURCHASE
KEYS
AND
OTHER
THINGS
HE
WILL
HAVE
PAPER
THAT
HEWRITE
ON
HE
WILL
HAVE
HIS
BOOK
OF
CHEQUES
THERE
ARE
MANY
BELONGINGSTHAT
HE
MUST
HAVE
SOMEWHERE
WHY
NOT
IN
THIS
PLACE
SO
CENTRAL
SO
QUIET
WHERE
HE
COME
AND
GO
BY
THE
FRONT
OR
THE
BACK
AT
ALL
HOUR
WHEN
IN
THEVERY
VAST
OF
THE
TRAFFIC
THERE
IS
NONE
TO
NOTICE
WE
SHALL
GO
THERE
ANDSEARCH
THAT
HOUSE
AND
WHEN
WE
LEARN
WHAT
IT
HOLDS
THEN
WE
DO
WHAT
OURFRIEND
ARTHUR
CALL
IN
HIS
PHRASES
OF
HUNT
STOP
THE
EARTHS
AND
SO
WERUN
DOWN
OUR
OLD
FOX
SO
IS
IT
NOT
THEN
LET
US
COME
AT
ONCE
I
CRIED
WE
ARE
WASTING
THE
PRECIOUS
PRECIOUS
TIME
THE
PROFESSOR
DID
NOT
MOVE
BUT
SIMPLY
SAID
AND
HOW
ARE
WE
TO
GET
INTO
THAT
HOUSE
IN
PICCADILLY
ANY
WAY
I
CRIED
WE
SHALL
BREAK
IN
IF
NEED
BE
AND
YOUR
POLICE
WHERE
WILL
THEY
BE
AND
WHAT
WILL
THEY
SAY
I
WAS
STAGGERED
BUT
I
KNEW
THAT
IF
HE
WISHED
TO
DELAY
HE
HAD
A
GOODREASON
FOR
IT
SO
I
SAID
AS
QUIETLY
AS
I
COULD
DON
T
WAIT
MORE
THAN
NEED
BE
YOU
KNOW
I
AM
SURE
WHAT
TORTURE
I
AMIN
AH
MY
CHILD
THAT
I
DO
AND
INDEED
THERE
IS
NO
WISH
OF
ME
TO
ADD
TOYOUR
ANGUISH
BUT
JUST
THINK
WHAT
CAN
WE
DO
UNTIL
ALL
THE
WORLD
BE
ATMOVEMENT
THEN
WILL
COME
OUR
TIME
I
HAVE
THOUGHT
AND
THOUGHT
AND
ITSEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
SIMPLEST
WAY
IS
THE
BEST
OF
ALL
NOW
WE
WISH
TO
GETINTO
THE
HOUSE
BUT
WE
HAVE
NO
KEY
IS
IT
NOT
SO
I
NODDED
NOW
SUPPOSE
THAT
YOU
WERE
IN
TRUTH
THE
OWNER
OF
THAT
HOUSE
AND
COULDNOT
STILL
GET
IT
AND
THINK
THERE
WAS
TO
YOU
NO
CONSCIENCE
OF
THEHOUSEBREAKER
WHAT
WOULD
YOU
DO
I
SHOULD
GET
A
RESPECTABLE
LOCKSMITH
AND
SET
HIM
TO
WORK
TO
PICK
THELOCK
FOR
ME
AND
YOUR
POLICE
THEY
WOULD
INTERFERE
WOULD
THEY
NOT
OH
NO
NOT
IF
THEY
KNEW
THE
MAN
WAS
PROPERLY
EMPLOYED
THEN
HE
LOOKED
AT
ME
AS
KEENLY
AS
HE
SPOKE
ALL
THAT
IS
IN
DOUBT
ISTHE
CONSCIENCE
OF
THE
EMPLOYER
AND
THE
BELIEF
OF
YOUR
POLICEMEN
AS
TOWHETHER
OR
NO
THAT
EMPLOYER
HAS
A
GOOD
CONSCIENCE
OR
A
BAD
ONE
YOURPOLICE
MUST
INDEED
BE
ZEALOUS
MEN
AND
CLEVER
OH
SO
CLEVER
IN
READINGTHE
HEART
THAT
THEY
TROUBLE
THEMSELVES
IN
SUCH
MATTER
NO

MYFRIEND
JONATHAN
YOU
GO
TAKE
THE
LOCK
OFF
A
HUNDRED
EMPTY
HOUSE
IN
THISYOUR
LONDON
OR
OF
ANY
CITY
IN
THE
WORLD
AND
IF
YOU
DO
IT
AS
SUCHTHINGS
ARE
RIGHTLY
DONE
AND
AT
THE
TIME
SUCH
THINGS
ARE
RIGHTLY
DONE
NO
ONE
WILL
INTERFERE
I
HAVE
READ
OF
A
GENTLEMAN
WHO
OWNED
A
SO
FINEHOUSE
IN
LONDON
AND
WHEN
HE
WENT
FOR
MONTHS
OF
SUMMER
TO
SWITZERLANDAND
LOCK
UP
HIS
HOUSE
SOME
BURGLAR
CAME
AND
BROKE
WINDOW
AT
BACK
ANDGOT
IN
THEN
HE
WENT
AND
MADE
OPEN
THE
SHUTTERS
IN
FRONT
AND
WALK
OUTAND
IN
THROUGH
THE
DOOR
BEFORE
THE
VERY
EYES
OF
THE
POLICE
THEN
HEHAVE
AN
AUCTION
IN
THAT
HOUSE
AND
ADVERTISE
IT
AND
PUT
UP
BIG
NOTICE
AND
WHEN
THE
DAY
COME
HE
SELL
OFF
BY
A
GREAT
AUCTIONEER
ALL
THE
GOODS
OFTHAT
OTHER
MAN
WHO
OWN
THEM
THEN
HE
GO
TO
A
BUILDER
AND
HE
SELL
HIMTHAT
HOUSE
MAKING
AN
AGREEMENT
THAT
HE
PULL
IT
DOWN
AND
TAKE
ALL
AWAYWITHIN
A
CERTAIN
TIME
AND
YOUR
POLICE
AND
OTHER
AUTHORITY
HELP
HIM
ALLTHEY
CAN
AND
WHEN
THAT
OWNER
COME
BACK
FROM
HIS
HOLIDAY
IN
SWITZERLANDHE
FIND
ONLY
AN
EMPTY
HOLE
WHERE
HIS
HOUSE
HAD
BEEN
THIS
WAS
ALL
DONE
EN
REGLE
AND
IN
OUR
WORK
WE
SHALL
BE
EN
REGLE
TOO
WE
SHALL
NOT
GOSO
EARLY
THAT
THE
POLICEMEN
WHO
HAVE
THEN
LITTLE
TO
THINK
OF
SHALL
DEEMIT
STRANGE
BUT
WE
SHALL
GO
AFTER
TEN
O
CLOCK
WHEN
THERE
ARE
MANYABOUT
AND
SUCH
THINGS
WOULD
BE
DONE
WERE
WE
INDEED
OWNERS
OF
THEHOUSE
I
COULD
NOT
BUT
SEE
HOW
RIGHT
HE
WAS
AND
THE
TERRIBLE
DESPAIR
OF
MINA
SFACE
BECAME
RELAXED
A
THOUGHT
THERE
WAS
HOPE
IN
SUCH
GOOD
COUNSEL
VANHELSING
WENT
ON
WHEN
ONCE
WITHIN
THAT
HOUSE
WE
MAY
FIND
MORE
CLUES
AT
ANY
RATE
SOME
OFUS
CAN
REMAIN
THERE
WHILST
THE
REST
FIND
THE
OTHER
PLACES
WHERE
THERE
BEMORE
EARTH
BOXES
AT
BERMONDSEY
AND
MILE
END
LORD
GODALMING
STOOD
UP
I
CAN
BE
OF
SOME
USE
HERE
HE
SAID
I
SHALLWIRE
TO
MY
PEOPLE
TO
HAVE
HORSES
AND
CARRIAGES
WHERE
THEY
WILL
BE
MOSTCONVENIENT
LOOK
HERE
OLD
FELLOW
SAID
MORRIS
IT
IS
A
CAPITAL
IDEA
TO
HAVE
ALLREADY
IN
CASE
WE
WANT
TO
GO
HORSEBACKING
BUT
DON
T
YOU
THINK
THAT
ONEOF
YOUR
SNAPPY
CARRIAGES
WITH
ITS
HERALDIC
ADORNMENTS
IN
A
BYWAY
OFWALWORTH
OR
MILE
END
WOULD
ATTRACT
TOO
MUCH
ATTENTION
FOR
OUR
PURPOSES
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
WE
OUGHT
TO
TAKE
CABS
WHEN
WE
GO
SOUTH
OR
EAST
ANDEVEN
LEAVE
THEM
SOMEWHERE
NEAR
THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD
WE
ARE
GOING
TO
FRIEND
QUINCEY
IS
RIGHT
SAID
THE
PROFESSOR
HIS
HEAD
IS
WHAT
YOUCALL
IN
PLANE
WITH
THE
HORIZON
IT
IS
A
DIFFICULT
THING
THAT
WE
GO
TODO
AND
WE
DO
NOT
WANT
NO
PEOPLES
TO
WATCH
US
IF
SO
IT
MAY
MINA
TOOK
A
GROWING
INTEREST
IN
EVERYTHING
AND
I
WAS
REJOICED
TO
SEETHAT
THE
EXIGENCY
OF
AFFAIRS
WAS
HELPING
HER
TO
FORGET
FOR
A
TIME
THETERRIBLE
EXPERIENCE
OF
THE
NIGHT
SHE
WAS
VERY
VERY
PALE
ALMOSTGHASTLY
AND
SO
THIN
THAT
HER
LIPS
WERE
DRAWN
AWAY
SHOWING
HER
TEETH
INSOMEWHAT
OF
PROMINENCE
I
DID
NOT
MENTION
THIS
LAST
LEST
IT
SHOULD
GIVEHER
NEEDLESS
PAIN
BUT
IT
MADE
MY
BLOOD
RUN
COLD
IN
MY
VEINS
TO
THINK
OFWHAT
HAD
OCCURRED
WITH
POOR
LUCY
WHEN
THE
COUNT
HAD
SUCKED
HER
BLOOD
ASYET
THERE
WAS
NO
SIGN
OF
THE
TEETH
GROWING
SHARPER
BUT
THE
TIME
AS
YETWAS
SHORT
AND
THERE
WAS
TIME
FOR
FEAR
WHEN
WE
CAME
TO
THE
DISCUSSION
OF
THE
SEQUENCE
OF
OUR
EFFORTS
AND
OF
THEDISPOSITION
OF
OUR
FORCES
THERE
WERE
NEW
SOURCES
OF
DOUBT
IT
WASFINALLY
AGREED
THAT
BEFORE
STARTING
FOR
PICCADILLY
WE
SHOULD
DESTROY
THECOUNT
S
LAIR
CLOSE
AT
HAND
IN
CASE
HE
SHOULD
FIND
IT
OUT
TOO
SOON
WESHOULD
THUS
BE
STILL
AHEAD
OF
HIM
IN
OUR
WORK
OF
DESTRUCTION
AND
HISPRESENCE
IN
HIS
PURELY
MATERIAL
SHAPE
AND
AT
HIS
WEAKEST
MIGHT
GIVE
USSOME
NEW
CLUE
AS
TO
THE
DISPOSAL
OF
FORCES
IT
WAS
SUGGESTED
BY
THE
PROFESSOR
THAT
AFTER
OUR
VISIT
TO
CARFAX
WE
SHOULD
ALL
ENTER
THE
HOUSE
IN
PICCADILLY
THAT
THE
TWO
DOCTORS
AND
I
SHOULD
REMAIN
THERE
WHILST
LORD
GODALMINGAND
QUINCEY
FOUND
THE
LAIRS
AT
WALWORTH
AND
MILE
END
AND
DESTROYED
THEM
IT
WAS
POSSIBLE
IF
NOT
LIKELY
THE
PROFESSOR
URGED
THAT
THE
COUNTMIGHT
APPEAR
IN
PICCADILLY
DURING
THE
DAY
AND
THAT
IF
SO
WE
MIGHT
BEABLE
TO
COPE
WITH
HIM
THEN
AND
THERE
AT
ANY
RATE
WE
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
TOFOLLOW
HIM
IN
FORCE
TO
THIS
PLAN
I
STRENUOUSLY
OBJECTED
AND
SO
FAR
ASMY
GOING
WAS
CONCERNED
FOR
I
SAID
THAT
I
INTENDED
TO
STAY
AND
PROTECTMINA
I
THOUGHT
THAT
MY
MIND
WAS
MADE
UP
ON
THE
SUBJECT
BUT
MINA
WOULDNOT
LISTEN
TO
MY
OBJECTION
SHE
SAID
THAT
THERE
MIGHT
BE
SOME
LAW
MATTERIN
WHICH
I
COULD
BE
USEFUL
THAT
AMONGST
THE
COUNT
S
PAPERS
MIGHT
BESOME
CLUE
WHICH
I
COULD
UNDERSTAND
OUT
OF
MY
EXPERIENCE
IN
TRANSYLVANIA
AND
THAT
AS
IT
WAS
ALL
THE
STRENGTH
WE
COULD
MUSTER
WAS
REQUIRED
TOCOPE
WITH
THE
COUNT
S
EXTRAORDINARY
POWER
I
HAD
TO
GIVE
IN
FOR
MINA
SRESOLUTION
WAS
FIXED
SHE
SAID
THAT
IT
WAS
THE
LAST
HOPE
FOR
HER
THATWE
SHOULD
ALL
WORK
TOGETHER
AS
FOR
ME
SHE
SAID
I
HAVE
NO
FEAR
THINGS
HAVE
BEEN
AS
BAD
AS
THEY
CAN
BE
AND
WHATEVER
MAY
HAPPEN
MUSTHAVE
IN
IT
SOME
ELEMENT
OF
HOPE
OR
COMFORT
GO
MY
HUSBAND
GOD
CAN
IFHE
WISHES
IT
GUARD
ME
AS
WELL
ALONE
AS
WITH
ANY
ONE
PRESENT
SO
ISTARTED
UP
CRYING
OUT
THEN
IN
GOD
S
NAME
LET
US
COME
AT
ONCE
FOR
WEARE
LOSING
TIME
THE

IT
WAS
HARD
TO
BELIEVE
THAT

THERE

NOW
MY

HERE
TO

WE
MUST
STERILISE

SO

THAT

FOR

THAT
THE

PRETTY
FREELY
WE
MOVED

TO

THAT

OVER
AND
OVER

SINCE
THEY
CAME
INTO
MY

THE
MORE
I
HAVE
STUDIED
THEGREATER
SEEMS
THE
NECESSITY
TO
UTTERLY
STAMP
HIM
OUT
ALL
THROUGH
THEREARE
SIGNS
OF
HIS
ADVANCE
NOT

OF
HIS
POWER
BUT
OF
HIS
KNOWLEDGE
OFIT
AS
I
LEARNED
FROM
THE
RESEARCHES
OF
MY

ARMINUS
OF
BUDA
PESTH
HE
WAS
IN

A
MOST
WONDERFUL
MAN
SOLDIER

THE
HIGHEST

OF
THESCIENCE

AND
A

THAT
KNEW
NO

NO

HE
DARED
EVEN
TOATTEND

THERE

SURVIVED

IT
WOULD
SEEM
THAT
MEMORY
WAS
NOT

COMPLETE
IN

HE
HAS
BEEN

THINGS
THAT
WERE
CHILDISH
AT
THE
FIRST
ARE
NOW
OFMAN

HE
IS
EXPERIMENTING
AND
DOING
IT
WELL
AND
IF
IT
HAD
NOTBEEN
THAT
WE
HAVE
CROSSED

HE
MAY

TO

HIM
HE
HAS
ALL

THAT

AT

TO

CERTAINTHINGS
HE
WOULD
LONG

HAVE
BEEN
BEYOND

AT

HOW
AT

ALL
THESE
SO
GREAT
BOXES
WERE
MOVED
BY
OTHERS
HEKNEW
NOT
THEN
BUT
THAT
MUST
BE
SO
BUT
ALL
THE
TIME
THAT
SO
GREATCHILD
BRAIN
OF
HIS
WAS
GROWING
AND
HE
BEGAN
TO
CONSIDER
WHETHER
HEMIGHT
NOT
HIMSELF
MOVE
THE

SO
HE
BEGAN
TO
HELP
AND
THEN
WHEN
HEFOUND
THAT
THIS
BE
ALL
RIGHT
HE
TRY
TO
MOVE

ALL
ALONE
AND
SO

AND
HE
SCATTER
THESE
GRAVES
OF
HIM

WHERETHEY
ARE
HIDDEN
HE
MAY
HAVE

BY

THEREWAS
NO

AND
I
TRIED
TO

BUT
THE

WAS
DESERTED
AND
NO

HAD
SEEN
HIM
DEPART
IT

LATE
IN

AFTERNOON
AND
SUNSET

TORECOGNISE
THAT

AT

PROTECT

WE
NEEDNOT
DESPAIR
THERE
IS
BUT
ONE
MORE
EARTH
BOX
AND
WE
MUST
TRY
TO
FINDIT
WHEN
THAT
IS
DONE
ALL
MAY
YET
BE
WELL
I
COULD
SEE
THAT
HE
SPOKE
ASBRAVELY
AS
HE
COULD
TO
COMFORT
HARKER
THE
POOR

WAS
QUITE
BROKENDOWN
NOW
AND
AGAIN
HE
GAVE
A
LOW
GROAN
WHICH
HE
COULD
NOT
SUPPRESS
HEWAS
THINKING
OF
HIS

WITH
SAD
HEARTS
WE
CAME
BACK
TO
MY

WHERE
WE
FOUND
MRS
HARKERWAITING
US
WITH
AN
APPEARANCE
OF
CHEERFULNESS
WHICH
DID
HONOUR
TO
HERBRAVERY
AND
UNSELFISHNESS
WHEN
SHE
SAW
OUR
FACES
HER

BECAME
ASPALE
AS
DEATH
FOR
A
SECOND
OR
TWO
HER
EYES
WERE
CLOSED
AS
IF
SHE
WEREIN

PRAYER
AND
THEN
SHE
SAID
CHEERFULLY
I
CAN
NEVER
THANK
YOU

ENOUGH
OH

SHE
TOOK

THEREWAS
NO
PLACE
FOR

IN
HIS
SUBLIME
MISERY
WE
HAD
A
SORT
OF
PERFUNCTORY
SUPPER
TOGETHER
AND
I
THINK
IT
CHEERED
USALL
UP
SOMEWHAT
IT
WAS
PERHAPS
THE
MERE
ANIMAL
HEAT
OF

TO
HUNGRYPEOPLE
FOR
NONE

ANYTHING
SINCE

MAY
HAVE
HELPED

BUT
ANYHOW
WE
WERE
ALL
LESSMISERABLE
AND
SAW
THE
MORROW
AS
NOT
ALTOGETHER
WITHOUT
HOPE
TRUE
TOOUR
PROMISE
WE
TOLD
MRS
HARKER
EVERYTHING
WHICH
HAD
PASSED
ANDALTHOUGH
SHE
GREW
SNOWY
WHITE
AT

WHEN

HAD
SEEMED
TOTHREATEN
HER

AND
RED
AT

WHEN
HIS

SHE
LISTENED
BRAVELY
AND
WITH
CALMNESS
WHEN
WE
CAME
TO
THEPART
WHERE
HARKER
HAD
RUSHED
AT
THE

SO
RECKLESSLY
SHE
CLUNG
TOHER
HUSBAND
S

AND
HELD
IT
TIGHT
AS
THOUGH
HER
CLINGING
COULDPROTECT
HIM
FROM
ANY
HARM
THAT
MIGHT
COME
SHE
SAID
NOTHING
HOWEVER
TILL
THE
NARRATION
WAS
ALL
DONE
AND
MATTERS
HAD
BEEN
BROUGHT
RIGHT
UPTO
THE
PRESENT
TIME
THEN
WITHOUT
LETTING
GO
HER
HUSBAND
S
HAND
SHESTOOD
UP
AMONGST
US
AND
SPOKE
OH

I
COULD
GIVE
ANY

ANDWE
KNOWING
THAT

WITH

FULL
OF

DESTROYED
IN
HIS

I
COULD
SEE

LEAPED
TO
HIS

ALMOST
TEARINGHIS

AND
MANIFESTLY
FOR

WAS
A
BRAVE
STRUGGLE
AND

AND

ITS
REWARD
VAN

HAD
PLACED

A

WHICH
EITHER

STRICKEN

JONATHAN
HARKER
S
JOURNAL
OCTOBER
CLOSE
TO
MIDNIGHT
I
THOUGHT
YESTERDAY
WOULD
NEVER
END
THERE
WAS
OVER
ME
A
YEARNING
FOR
SLEEP
IN
SOME
SORT
OF
BLIND
BELIEFTHAT
TO
WAKE
WOULD
BE
TO
FIND
THINGS
CHANGED
AND
THAT
ANY
CHANGE
MUSTNOW
BE
FOR
THE
BETTER
BEFORE
WE
PARTED
WE
DISCUSSED
WHAT
OUR
NEXT
STEPWAS
TO
BE
BUT
WE
COULD
ARRIVE
AT
NO
RESULT
ALL
WE
KNEW
WAS
THAT
ONEEARTH
BOX
REMAINED
AND
THAT
THE
COUNT
ALONE
KNEW
WHERE
IT
WAS
IF
HECHOOSES
TO
LIE
HIDDEN
HE
MAY
BAFFLE
US
FOR
YEARS
AND
IN
THEMEANTIME
THE
THOUGHT
IS
TOO
HORRIBLE
I
DARE
NOT
THINK
OF
IT
EVEN
NOW
THIS
I
KNOW
THAT
IF
EVER
THERE
WAS
A
WOMAN
WHO
WAS
ALL
PERFECTION
THATONE
IS
MY
POOR
WRONGED
DARLING
I
LOVE
HER
A
THOUSAND
TIMES
MORE
FOR
HERSWEET
PITY
OF
LAST
NIGHT
A
PITY
THAT
MADE
MY
OWN
HATE
OF
THE
MONSTERSEEM
DESPICABLE
SURELY
GOD
WILL
NOT
PERMIT
THE
WORLD
TO
BE
THE
POORERBY
THE
LOSS
OF
SUCH
A
CREATURE
THIS
IS
HOPE
TO
ME
WE
ARE
ALL
DRIFTINGREEFWARDS
NOW
AND
FAITH
IS
OUR
ONLY
ANCHOR
THANK
GOD
MINA
ISSLEEPING
AND
SLEEPING
WITHOUT
DREAMS
I
FEAR
WHAT
HER
DREAMS
MIGHT
BELIKE
WITH
SUCH
TERRIBLE
MEMORIES
TO
GROUND
THEM
IN
SHE
HAS
NOT
BEEN
SOCALM
WITHIN
MY
SEEING
SINCE
THE
SUNSET
THEN
FOR
A
WHILE
THERE
CAMEOVER
HER
FACE
A
REPOSE
WHICH
WAS
LIKE
SPRING
AFTER
THE
BLASTS
OF
MARCH
I
THOUGHT
AT
THE
TIME
THAT
IT
WAS
THE
SOFTNESS
OF
THE
RED
SUNSET
ON
HERFACE
BUT
SOMEHOW
NOW
I
THINK
IT
HAS
A
DEEPER
MEANING
I
AM
NOT
SLEEPYMYSELF
THOUGH
I
AM
WEARY
WEARY
TO
DEATH
HOWEVER
I
MUST
TRY
TO
SLEEP
FOR
THERE
IS
TO
MORROW
TO
THINK
OF
AND
THERE
IS
NO
REST
FOR
MEUNTIL
LATER
I
MUST
HAVE
FALLEN
ASLEEP
FOR
I
WAS
AWAKED
BY
MINA
WHO
WASSITTING
UP
IN

WITH
A
STARTLED
LOOK
ON
HER
FACE
I
COULD
SEE
EASILY
FOR
WE
DID
NOT
LEAVE
THE

IN
DARKNESS
SHE
HAD
PLACED
A
WARNING
HANDOVER
MY
MOUTH
AND
NOW
SHE
WHISPERED
IN
MY
EAR
HUSH
THERE
IS
SOMEONE
IN
THE
CORRIDOR
I
GOT
UP
SOFTLY
AND
CROSSINGTHE
ROOM
GENTLY
OPENED
THE

JUST

STRETCHED
ON
A
MATTRESS

MR

WIDE
AWAKE
HERAISED
A

BE
HERE
ALLNIGHT

SO
I
CAME

SHE
SIGHED
AND
POSITIVELY
A

LAUGHED
AS
THEY
TOLD
HOW
THE

S
SWEARSEXCEEDED
EVEN
HIS
USUAL
POLYGLOT
AND
WAS
MORE
THAN
EVER
FULL
OFPICTURESQUE
WHEN
ON
QUESTIONING
OTHER
MARINERS
WHO
WERE
ON
MOVEMENT
UPAND
DOWN
ON
THE
RIVER
THAT
HOUR
HE
FOUND
THAT
FEW
OF
THEM
HAD
SEEN
ANYOF
FOG
AT
ALL
EXCEPT
WHERE
IT
LAY
ROUND
THE
WHARF
HOWEVER
THE
SHIPWENT
OUT
ON
THE

TIDE
AND
WAS
DOUBTLESS
BY
MORNING
FAR
DOWN
THERIVER
MOUTH
SHE
WAS
BY
THEN
WHEN
THEY
TOLD
US
WELL
OUT
TO

AND
SO
MY
DEAR
MADAM
MINA
IT
IS
THAT
WE
HAVE
TO
REST
FOR
A
TIME
FOROUR
ENEMY
IS
ON
THE
SEA
WITH
THE
FOG
AT
HIS
COMMAND
ON
HIS
WAY
TO
THEDANUBE
MOUTH
TO
SAIL
A
SHIP
TAKES
TIME
GO
SHE
NEVER
SO
QUICK
AND
WHENWE
START
WE
GO
ON
LAND
MORE
QUICK
AND
WE
MEET
HIM
THERE
OUR
BEST
HOPEIS
TO
COME
ON
HIM
WHEN
IN
THE
BOX
BETWEEN
SUNRISE
AND
SUNSET
FOR
THENHE
CAN
MAKE
NO
STRUGGLE
AND
WE
MAY
DEAL
WITH
HIM
AS
WE
SHOULD
THEREARE
DAYS
FOR
US
IN
WHICH
WE
CAN
MAKE
READY
OUR
PLAN
WE
KNOW
ALL
ABOUTWHERE
HE
GO
FOR
WE
HAVE
SEEN
THE
OWNER
OF
THE
SHIP
WHO
HAVE
SHOWN
USINVOICES
AND
ALL
PAPERS
THAT
CAN
BE
THE
BOX
WE
SEEK
IS
TO
BE
LANDED
INVARNA
AND
TO
BE
GIVEN
TO
AN
AGENT
ONE
RISTICS
WHO
WILL
THERE
PRESENTHIS
CREDENTIALS
AND
SO
OUR
MERCHANT
FRIEND
WILL
HAVE
DONE
HIS
PART
WHEN
HE
ASK
IF
THERE
BE
ANY
WRONG
FOR
THAT
SO
HE
CAN
TELEGRAPH
ANDHAVE
INQUIRY
MADE
AT
VARNA
WE
SAY
NO
FOR
WHAT
IS
TO
BE
DONE
IS
NOTFOR
POLICE
OR
OF
THE
CUSTOMS
IT
MUST
BE
DONE
BY
US
ALONE
AND
IN
OUR
OWNWAY
WHEN
DR
VAN
HELSING
HAD
DONE
SPEAKING
I
ASKED
HIM
IF
HE
WERE
CERTAINTHAT
THE
COUNT
HAD
REMAINED
ON
BOARD
THE
SHIP
HE
REPLIED
WE
HAVE
THEBEST
PROOF
OF
THAT
YOUR
OWN
EVIDENCE
WHEN
IN
THE
HYPNOTIC
TRANCE
THISMORNING
I
ASKED
HIM
AGAIN
IF
IT
WERE
REALLY
NECESSARY
THAT
THEY
SHOULDPURSUE
THE
COUNT
FOR
OH
I
DREAD
JONATHAN
LEAVING
ME

I
KNOW
THATHE
WOULD
SURELY
GO
IF
THE
OTHERS
WENT
HE
ANSWERED
IN
GROWING
PASSION
AT
FIRST
QUIETLY
AS
HE
WENT
ON
HOWEVER
HE
GREW
MORE
ANGRY
AND
MOREFORCEFUL
TILL
IN
THE
END
WE
COULD
NOT
BUT
SEE
WHEREIN
WAS
AT
LEAST
SOMEOF
THAT
PERSONAL
DOMINANCE
WHICH
MADE
HIM
SO
LONG
A
MASTER
AMONGSTMEN
YES

IS
NECESSARY

HAS
DONE
MUCH
HARMALREADY
IN
THE
NARROW
SCOPE
WHERE

IN
THE
SHORTTIME
WHEN

WONDERFUL
PEACE
AND
REST
TO
NIGHT
IT
IS
AS
IF
SOME
HAUNTINGPRESENCE
WERE
REMOVED
FROM
ME
PERHAPS
MY
SURMISE
WAS
NOT
FINISHED
COULD
NOT
BE
FOR
I
CAUGHT
SIGHT
IN
THEMIRROR
OF
THE
RED
MARK
UPON
MY
FOREHEAD
AND
I
KNEW
THAT
I
WAS
STILLUNCLEAN
DR
SEWARD
S
DIARY
OCTOBER
WE
ALL
ROSE
EARLY
AND
I
THINK
THAT
SLEEP
DID
MUCH
FOREACH
AND
ALL
OF
US
WHEN
WE
MET
AT
EARLY
BREAKFAST
THERE
WAS
MOREGENERAL
CHEERFULNESS
THAN
ANY
OF
US
HAD
EVER
EXPECTED
TO
EXPERIENCEAGAIN
IT
IS
REALLY
WONDERFUL
HOW
MUCH
RESILIENCE
THERE
IS
IN
HUMAN
NATURE
LETANY
OBSTRUCTING
CAUSE
NO
MATTER
WHAT
BE
REMOVED
IN
ANY
WAY
EVEN
BYDEATH
AND
WE
FLY
BACK
TO
FIRST
PRINCIPLES
OF
HOPE
AND
ENJOYMENT
MORETHAN
ONCE
AS
WE
SAT
AROUND
THE
TABLE
MY
EYES
OPENED
IN
WONDER
WHETHERTHE
WHOLE
OF
THE
PAST
DAYS
HAD
NOT
BEEN
A
DREAM
IT
WAS
ONLY
WHEN
ICAUGHT
SIGHT
OF
THE
RED
BLOTCH
ON
MRS
HARKER
S
FOREHEAD
THAT
I
WASBROUGHT
BACK
TO
REALITY
EVEN
NOW
WHEN
I
AM
GRAVELY
REVOLVING
THEMATTER
IT
IS
ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
REALISE
THAT
THE
CAUSE
OF
ALL
OURTROUBLE
IS
STILL
EXISTENT
EVEN
MRS
HARKER
SEEMS
TO
LOSE
SIGHT
OF
HERTROUBLE
FOR
WHOLE
SPELLS
IT
IS
ONLY
NOW
AND
AGAIN
WHEN
SOMETHINGRECALLS
IT
TO
HER
MIND
THAT
SHE
THINKS
OF
HER
TERRIBLE
SCAR
WE
ARE
TOMEET
HERE
IN
MY
STUDY
IN
HALF
AN
HOUR
AND
DECIDE
ON
OUR
COURSE
OFACTION
I
SEE
ONLY
ONE
IMMEDIATE
DIFFICULTY
I
KNOW
IT
BY
INSTINCTRATHER
THAN
REASON
WE
SHALL
ALL
HAVE
TO
SPEAK
FRANKLY
AND
YET
I
FEARTHAT
IN
SOME
MYSTERIOUS
WAY
POOR
MRS
HARKER
S
TONGUE
IS
TIED
I
KNOW
THAT
SHE
FORMS
CONCLUSIONS
OF
HER
OWN
AND
FROM
ALL
THAT
HAS
BEEN
I
CANGUESS
HOW
BRILLIANT
AND
HOW
TRUE
THEY
MUST
BE
BUT
SHE
WILL
NOT
ORCANNOT
GIVE
THEM
UTTERANCE
I
HAVE
MENTIONED
THIS
TO
VAN
HELSING
ANDHE
AND
I
ARE
TO
TALK
IT
OVER
WHEN
WE
ARE
ALONE
I
SUPPOSE
IT
IS
SOME
OFTHAT
HORRID
POISON
WHICH
HAS
GOT
INTO
HER
VEINS
BEGINNING
TO
WORK
THECOUNT
HAD
HIS
OWN
PURPOSES
WHEN
HE
GAVE
HER
WHAT
VAN
HELSING
CALLED
THEVAMPIRE
S
BAPTISM
OF
BLOOD
WELL
THERE
MAY
BE
A
POISON
THAT
DISTILSITSELF
OUT
OF
GOOD
THINGS
IN
AN
AGE
WHEN
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
PTOMAINES
ISA
MYSTERY
WE
SHOULD
NOT
WONDER
AT
ANYTHING
ONE
THING
I
KNOW
THAT
IF
MYINSTINCT
BE
TRUE
REGARDING
POOR
MRS
HARKER
S
SILENCES
THEN
THERE
IS
ATERRIBLE
DIFFICULTY
AN
UNKNOWN
DANGER
IN
THE
WORK
BEFORE
US
THE
SAMEPOWER
THAT
COMPELS
HER
SILENCE
MAY
COMPEL
HER
SPEECH
I
DARE
NOT
THINKFURTHER
FOR
SO
I
SHOULD
IN
MY
THOUGHTS
DISHONOUR
A
NOBLE
WOMAN
VAN
HELSING
IS
COMING
TO
MY
STUDY
A
LITTLE
BEFORE
THE
OTHERS
I
SHALLTRY
TO
OPEN
THE
SUBJECT
WITH
HIM
LATER
WHEN
THE
PROFESSOR
CAME
IN
WE
TALKED
OVER
THE
STATE
OFTHINGS
I
COULD
SEE
THAT
HE
HAD
SOMETHING
ON
HIS
MIND
WHICH
HE
WANTED
TOSAY
BUT
FELT
SOME
HESITANCY
ABOUT
BROACHING
THE
SUBJECT
AFTER
BEATINGABOUT
THE
BUSH
A
LITTLE
HE
SAID
SUDDENLY
FRIEND
JOHN
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
THAT
YOU
AND
I
MUST
TALK
OF
ALONE
JUSTAT
THE
FIRST
AT
ANY
RATE
LATER
WE
MAY
HAVE
TO
TAKE
THE
OTHERS
INTO
OURCONFIDENCE
THEN
HE
STOPPED
SO
I
WAITED
HE
WENT
ON
MADAM
MINA
OUR
POOR
DEAR
MADAM
MINA
IS
CHANGING
A
COLD
SHIVER
RANTHROUGH
ME
TO
FIND
MY
WORST
FEARS
THUS
ENDORSED
VAN
HELSINGCONTINUED
WITH
THE
SAD
EXPERIENCE
OF
MISS
LUCY
WE
MUST
THIS
TIME
BE
WARNEDBEFORE
THINGS
GO
TOO
FAR
OUR
TASK
IS
NOW
IN
REALITY
MORE
DIFFICULT
THANEVER
AND
THIS
NEW
TROUBLE
MAKES
EVERY
HOUR
OF
THE
DIREST
IMPORTANCE
ICAN
SEE
THE
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
THE
VAMPIRE
COMING
IN
HER
FACE
IT
IS
NOWBUT
VERY
VERY
SLIGHT
BUT
IT
IS
TO
BE
SEEN
IF
WE
HAVE
EYES
TO
NOTICEWITHOUT
TO
PREJUDGE
HER
TEETH
ARE
SOME
SHARPER
AND
AT
TIMES
HER
EYESARE
MORE
HARD
BUT
THESE
ARE
NOT
ALL
THERE
IS
TO
HER
THE
SILENCE
NOWOFTEN
AS
SO
IT
WAS
WITH
MISS
LUCY
SHE
DID
NOT
SPEAK
EVEN
WHEN
SHEWROTE
THAT
WHICH
SHE
WISHED
TO
BE
KNOWN
LATER
NOW
MY
FEAR
IS
THIS
IFIT
BE
THAT
SHE
CAN
BY
OUR
HYPNOTIC
TRANCE
TELL
WHAT
THE
COUNT
SEE
ANDHEAR
IS
IT
NOT
MORE
TRUE
THAT
HE
WHO
HAVE
HYPNOTISE
HER
FIRST
AND
WHOHAVE
DRINK
OF
HER
VERY
BLOOD
AND
MAKE
HER
DRINK
OF
HIS
SHOULD
IF
HEWILL
COMPEL
HER
MIND
TO
DISCLOSE
TO
HIM
THAT
WHICH
SHE
KNOW
I
NODDEDACQUIESCENCE
HE
WENT
ON
THEN
WHAT
WE
MUST
DO
IS
TO
PREVENT
THIS
WE
MUST
KEEP
HER
IGNORANT
OFOUR
INTENT
AND
SO
SHE
CANNOT
TELL
WHAT
SHE
KNOW
NOT
THIS
IS
A
PAINFULTASK
OH
SO
PAINFUL
THAT
IT
HEART
BREAK
ME
TO
THINK
OF
BUT
IT
MUST
BE
WHEN
TO
DAY
WE
MEET
I
MUST
TELL
HER
THAT
FOR
REASON
WHICH
WE
WILL
NOTTO
SPEAK
SHE
MUST
NOT
MORE
BE
OF
OUR
COUNCIL
BUT
BE
SIMPLY
GUARDED
BYUS
HE
WIPED
HIS
FOREHEAD
WHICH
HAD
BROKEN
OUT
IN
PROFUSE
PERSPIRATIONAT
THE
THOUGHT
OF
THE
PAIN
WHICH
HE
MIGHT
HAVE
TO
INFLICT
UPON
THE
POORSOUL
ALREADY
SO
TORTURED
I
KNEW
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
SOME
SORT
OF
COMFORTTO
HIM
IF
I
TOLD
HIM
THAT
I
ALSO
HAD
COME
TO
THE
SAME
CONCLUSION
FOR
ATANY
RATE
IT
WOULD
TAKE
AWAY
THE
PAIN
OF
DOUBT
I
TOLD
HIM
AND
THEEFFECT
WAS
AS
I
EXPECTED
IT
IS
NOW
CLOSE
TO
THE
TIME
OF
OUR
GENERAL
GATHERING
VAN
HELSING
HASGONE
AWAY
TO
PREPARE
FOR
THE
MEETING
AND
HIS
PAINFUL
PART
OF
IT
IREALLY
BELIEVE
HIS
PURPOSE
IS
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
PRAY
ALONE
LATER
AT
THE
VERY
OUTSET
OF
OUR
MEETING
A
GREAT
PERSONAL
RELIEF
WASEXPERIENCED
BY
BOTH
VAN
HELSING
AND
MYSELF
MRS
HARKER
HAD
SENT
AMESSAGE
BY
HER
HUSBAND
TO
SAY
THAT
SHE
WOULD
NOT
JOIN
US
AT
PRESENT
ASSHE
THOUGHT
IT
BETTER
THAT
WE
SHOULD
BE
FREE
TO
DISCUSS
OUR
MOVEMENTSWITHOUT
HER
PRESENCE
TO
EMBARRASS
US
THE
PROFESSOR
AND
I
LOOKED
AT
EACHOTHER
FOR
AN
INSTANT
AND
SOMEHOW
WE
BOTH
SEEMED
RELIEVED
FOR
MY
OWNPART
I
THOUGHT
THAT
IF
MRS
HARKER
REALISED
THE
DANGER
HERSELF
IT
WASMUCH
PAIN
AS
WELL
AS
MUCH

TOUNDERSTAND
THAT

TIMES
OF
PECULIAR
FREEDOM

CAN

QUICKLY
PRECEDED
ONLY
BY
A

OFWARNING

WE
WERE
NEITHER
OF

HAPPY
ABOUT
IT
SHEHAD
BEEN
RESTLESS
ALL
THE

SO
THAT
WE
WERE
AT
FIRST
GLAD
TO
KNOWTHAT
SHE
WAS
SLEEPING
WHEN
HOWEVER
HER
HUSBAND
MENTIONED
CASUALLYTHAT
SHE
WAS
SLEEPING
SO
SOUNDLY
THAT
HE
COULD
NOT
WAKE
HER
WE
WENT
TOHER
ROOM
TO
SEE
FOR
OURSELVES
SHE
WAS
BREATHING
NATURALLY
AND
LOOKED
SOWELL
AND
PEACEFUL
THAT
WE
AGREED
THAT
THE
SLEEP
WAS
BETTER
FOR
HER
THANANYTHING
ELSE
POOR
GIRL
SHE
HAS
SO
MUCH
TO
FORGET
THAT
IT
IS
NO
WONDERTHAT

DOES
HER
GOOD
LATER
OUR
OPINION
WAS
JUSTIFIED
FOR
WHEN

LOOKED
HAPPIER
AT

SEEMED
TOREALISE

BUT
VAN

AND
I
TURNING
TOEACH

MET
EACH
A
GRAVE
AND
TROUBLED
GLANCE
WE
SAID
NOTHING
AT
THETIME
HOWEVER
WHEN
THE
THREE

HAD
GONE
OUT
TO

VAN

ASKED

SO
DO
YOU

WHY
I
ASKED

GREAT
A
TERRIBLE
RISK
BUT
I

IS
RIGHT
IN

MOMENT
WHEN

THAT
ARREST
BOTH
OUR
UNDERSTANDING
AN
INSPIRATION
CAME

INTHE

BOX
IN

RUSHING
JUST
AS

OPEN
LIFE
WITHEYES
TO

AND
EARS
TO

AT

IS
SURE
WITH

OUT
OF

HIS

IS
ACLUE
AND
THE
ONE
PAGE
OF
IT
THAT
WE
KNOW
AND
THAT
FROM
HIS

TELLS
THAT
ONCE
BEFORE
WHEN
IN
WHAT
MR

A
TIGHT
PLACE
HE
WENT
BACK
TO
HIS

COUNTRY
FROM

WITHOUT

PREPARED
HIMSELFFOR
A
NEW
EFFORT
HE

AGAIN
BETTER
EQUIPPED
FOR

SO
HE

TO
LONDON
TO
INVADE
A
NEW

HE
WAS
BEATEN
AND
WHEN
ALLHOPE
OF
SUCCESS
WAS
LOST
AND
HIS
EXISTENCE
IN
DANGER
HE
FLED
BACK
OVERTHE

TURKEY
LAND
GOOD

OH

ENTHUSIASTICALLY
AS

LATER
HESAID
TO

AS
THOUGH
WE

FORGIVE
ME
IF
I
SEEM
EGOTISTICAL
NAY
FEAR
NOT
YOU
MUST
BE
EGOTIST
FOR
IT
IS
OF
YOU
THAT
WE
THINK
THEN
AS
HE
IS
CRIMINAL
HE
IS
SELFISH
AND
AS
HIS
INTELLECT
IS
SMALLAND
HIS
ACTION
IS
BASED
ON
SELFISHNESS
HE
CONFINES
HIMSELF
TO
ONEPURPOSE
THAT
PURPOSE
IS
REMORSELESS
AS
HE
FLED
BACK
OVER
THE
DANUBE
LEAVING
HIS
FORCES
TO
BE
CUT
TO
PIECES
SO
NOW
HE
IS
INTENT
ON
BEINGSAFE
CARELESS
OF
ALL
SO
HIS
OWN
SELFISHNESS
FREES
MY
SOUL
SOMEWHATFROM
THE
TERRIBLE
POWER
WHICH

RUSHED
THROUGH

UP
TOGALATZ
WHERE
DOUBTLESS
HE
HAD
MADE
PREPARATION
FOR
ESCAPING
FROM

BUT
HIS
CHILD
MIND
ONLY
SAW
SO
FAR
AND
IT
MAY
BE
THAT
AS
EVER
IS
INGOD
S
PROVIDENCE
THE
VERY
THING
THAT
THE
EVIL
DOER

RECKONED
ON
FORHIS

TURNS
OUT
TO
BE
HIS
CHIEFEST
HARM
THE
HUNTER
IS
TAKENIN
HIS

AS
THE

SAYS
FOR

FREE
FROM
EVERY
TRACE
OF
US
ALL
AND
THAT
HE
HAS
ESCAPED
US
WITH
SOMANY

ANDMORE
SERIOUS
EFFORT
ON
THE
PART
OF

THAN
HAS
BEEN
USUALLYNECESSARY
SHE
SANK
INTO
THE
TRANCE
USUALLY
SHE
SPEAKS
ON
A
HINT
BUTTHIS
TIME
THE
PROFESSOR
HAD
TO
ASK
HER
QUESTIONS
AND
TO
ASK
THEM
PRETTYRESOLUTELY
BEFORE
WE
COULD
LEARN
ANYTHING
AT
LAST
HER
ANSWER
CAME
I
CAN
SEE
NOTHING
WE
ARE
STILL
THERE
ARE
NO
WAVES
LAPPING
BUT
ONLY
ASTEADY
SWIRL
OF
WATER
SOFTLY
RUNNING
AGAINST
THE
HAWSER
I
CAN
HEARMEN
S
VOICES
CALLING
NEAR
AND
FAR
AND
THE
ROLL
AND
CREAK
OF
OARS
INTHE
ROWLOCKS
A
GUN
IS
FIRED
SOMEWHERE
THE
ECHO
OF
IT
SEEMS
FAR
AWAY
THERE
IS
TRAMPING
OF
FEET
OVERHEAD
AND
ROPES
AND
CHAINS
ARE
DRAGGEDALONG
WHAT
IS
THIS
THERE
IS
A
GLEAM
OF
LIGHT
I
CAN
FEEL
THE
AIRBLOWING
UPON
ME
HERE
SHE
STOPPED
SHE
HAD
RISEN
AS
IF
IMPULSIVELY
FROM
WHERE
SHE
LAYON
THE
SOFA
AND
RAISED
BOTH
HER
HANDS
PALMS
UPWARDS
AS
IF
LIFTING
AWEIGHT
VAN
HELSING
AND
I
LOOKED
AT
EACH
OTHER
WITH
UNDERSTANDING
QUINCEY
RAISED
HIS
EYEBROWS
SLIGHTLY
AND
LOOKED
AT
HER
INTENTLY
WHILSTHARKER
S
HAND
INSTINCTIVELY
CLOSED
ROUND
THE
HILT
OF
HIS
KUKRI
THEREWAS
A
LONG
PAUSE
WE
ALL
KNEW
THAT
THE
TIME
WHEN
SHE
COULD
SPEAK
WASPASSING
BUT
WE
FELT
THAT
IT
WAS
USELESS
TO
SAY
ANYTHING
SUDDENLY
SHESAT
UP
AND
AS
SHE
OPENED
HER
EYES
SAID
SWEETLY
WOULD
NONE
OF
YOU
LIKE
A
CUP
OF
TEA
YOU
MUST
ALL
BE
SO
TIRED
WECOULD
ONLY
MAKE
HER
HAPPY
AND
SO
ACQUIESCED
SHE
BUSTLED
OFF
TO
GETTEA
WHEN
SHE
HAD
GONE
VAN
HELSING
SAID
YOU
SEE
MY
FRIENDS
HE
IS
CLOSE
TO

HE
HAS
LEFT
HISEARTH
CHEST
BUT
HE
HAS
YET
TO
GET
ON
SHORE
IN
THE
NIGHT
HE
MAY
LIEHIDDEN
SOMEWHERE
BUT
IF
HE
BE
NOT
CARRIED
ON
SHORE
OR
IF
THE
SHIP
DONOT
TOUCH
IT
HE
CANNOT
ACHIEVE
THE
LAND
IN
SUCH
CASE
HE
CAN
IF
IT
BEIN
THE
NIGHT
CHANGE
HIS
FORM
AND
CAN
JUMP
OR
FLY
ON
SHORE
AS
HE
DIDAT
WHITBY
BUT
IF
THE
DAY
COME
BEFORE
HE
GET
ON
SHORE
THEN
UNLESS
HEBE
CARRIED
HE
CANNOT
ESCAPE
AND
IF
HE
BE
CARRIED
THEN
THE
CUSTOMS
MENMAY
DISCOVER
WHAT
THE
BOX
CONTAIN
THUS
IN
FINE
IF
HE
ESCAPE
NOT
ONSHORE
TO
NIGHT
OR
BEFORE
DAWN
THERE
WILL
BE
THE
WHOLE
DAY
LOST
TO
HIM
WE
MAY
THEN
ARRIVE
IN
TIME
FOR
IF
HE
ESCAPE
NOT
AT
NIGHT
WE
SHALL
COMEON
HIM
IN
DAYTIME
BOXED
UP
AND
AT
OUR
MERCY
FOR

NOT
BE
HISTRUE
SELF
AWAKE
AND
VISIBLE
LEST
HE
BE
DISCOVERED
THERE
WAS
NO
MORE
TO
BE
SAID
SO
WE
WAITED
IN
PATIENCE
UNTIL
THE
DAWN
AT
WHICH
TIME
WE
MIGHT
LEARN
MORE
FROM
MRS
HARKER
EARLY
THIS
MORNING
WE
LISTENED
WITH
BREATHLESS
ANXIETY
FOR
HERRESPONSE
IN
HER
TRANCE
THE
HYPNOTIC
STAGE
WAS
EVEN
LONGER
IN
COMINGTHAN
BEFORE
AND
WHEN
IT
CAME
THE
TIME
REMAINING
UNTIL
FULL
SUNRISE
WASSO
SHORT
THAT
WE
BEGAN
TO
DESPAIR
VAN
HELSING
SEEMED
TO
THROW
HIS
WHOLESOUL
INTO
THE

AT

IN
OBEDIENCE
TO
HIS

SHE
MADEREPLY
ALL
IS
DARK
I
HEAR
LAPPING
WATER
LEVEL
WITH
ME
AND
SOME
CREAKING
ASOF
WOOD
ON
WOOD
SHE
PAUSED
AND
THE
RED
SUN
SHOT
UP
WE
MUST
WAIT
TILLTO
NIGHT
AND
SO
IT
IS
THAT
WE
ARE
TRAVELLING
TOWARDS
GALATZ
IN
AN
AGONY
OFEXPECTATION
WE
ARE
DUE
TO
ARRIVE
BETWEEN
TWO
AND
THREE
IN
THE
MORNING
BUT
ALREADY
AT
BUCHAREST
WE
ARE
THREE
HOURS
LATE
SO
WE
CANNOTPOSSIBLY
GET
IN
TILL
WELL
AFTER

UP
THUS
WE
SHALL
HAVE
TWO
MOREHYPNOTIC
MESSAGES
FROM
MRS

EITHER
OR

POSSIBLY
THROWMORE
LIGHT
ON
WHAT
IS
HAPPENING
LATER
SUNSET
HAS
COME
AND
GONE
FORTUNATELY
IT
CAME
AT
A
TIME
WHENTHERE
WAS
NO
DISTRACTION
FOR
HAD
IT
OCCURRED
WHILST
WE
WERE
AT
ASTATION
WE
MIGHT
NOT
HAVE
SECURED
THE
NECESSARY
CALM
AND
ISOLATION
MRS
HARKER
YIELDED
TO
THE
HYPNOTIC
INFLUENCE
EVEN
LESS
READILY
THANTHIS
MORNING
I
AM
IN
FEAR
THAT
HER
POWER
OF
READING
THE
COUNT
SSENSATIONS
MAY
DIE
AWAY
JUST
WHEN
WE
WANT
IT
MOST
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THATHER
IMAGINATION
IS
BEGINNING
TO
WORK
WHILST
SHE
HAS
BEEN
IN
THE
TRANCEHITHERTO
SHE
HAS
CONFINED
HERSELF
TO
THE
SIMPLEST
OF
FACTS
IF
THIS
GOESON
IT
MAY
ULTIMATELY
MISLEAD
US
IF
I
THOUGHT
THAT
THE
COUNT
S
POWEROVER
HER
WOULD
DIE
AWAY
EQUALLY
WITH
HER
POWER
OF
KNOWLEDGE
IT
WOULD
BEA
HAPPY
THOUGHT
BUT
I
AM
AFRAID
THAT
IT
MAY
NOT
BE
SO
WHEN
SHE
DIDSPEAK
HER
WORDS
WERE
ENIGMATICAL
SOMETHING
IS
GOING
OUT
I
CAN
FEEL
IT
PASS
ME
LIKE
A
COLD
WIND
I
CANHEAR
FAR
OFF
CONFUSED
SOUNDS
AS
OF
MEN
TALKING
IN
STRANGE
TONGUES
FIERCE
FALLING
WATER
AND
THE
HOWLING
OF
WOLVES
SHE
STOPPED
AND
ASHUDDER
RAN
THROUGH
HER
INCREASING
IN
INTENSITY
FOR
A
FEW
SECONDS
TILL
AT
THE
END
SHE
SHOOK
AS
THOUGH
IN
A
PALSY
SHE
SAID
NO
MORE
EVENIN
ANSWER
TO
THE
PROFESSOR
S
IMPERATIVE
QUESTIONING
WHEN
SHE
WOKE
FROMTHE
TRANCE

HE
IS
BETWEEN

HOW
IS
HE
TO

HERE
A

BY

THERE
ARE

Y
THERE

Z
HIS

THIS
IS
HIS

FEAR
AND
IN
ORDERTO
PREVENT
HIS
BEING
BETRAYED
HE
HAS
REPELLED
SO
FAR
AS
HE
CAN
EVENHIS
VICTIM
ME
BY

THERE
IS
NO
ONE
IN
CHARGE
OF
THE

IT
WOULD
HAVE
TOTAKE
ITS
CHANCE
OF
BEING
DELAYED
AND
DELAY
WOULD
BE
FATAL
WITH
ENEMIESON
THE
TRACK
TRUE
HE
MIGHT
ESCAPE
AT

BUT
WHAT
WOULD
HE
BE
IFLEFT
IN
A
STRANGE
PLACE
WITH
NO
REFUGE
THAT
HE
COULD
FLY
TO
THIS
IS
NOTWHAT
HE
INTENDS
AND
HE
DOES
NOT
MEAN
TO
RISK
IT
BY
WATER
HERE
IS
THE
SAFEST
WAY
IN
ONE
RESPECT
BUT
WITH
MOSTDANGER
IN
ANOTHER
ON
THE
WATER
HE
IS
POWERLESS
EXCEPT
AT
NIGHT
EVENTHEN
HE
CAN
ONLY
SUMMON
FOG
AND
STORM
AND
SNOW
AND
HIS
WOLVES
BUT
WEREHE
WRECKED
THE
LIVING
WATER
WOULD
ENGULF
HIM
HELPLESS
AND
HE
WOULDINDEED
BE
LOST
HE
COULD
HAVE
THE

DRIVE
TO

BUT
IF
IT
WEREUNFRIENDLY
LAND
WHEREIN
HE
WAS
NOT
FREE
TO
MOVE
HIS
POSITION
WOULDSTILL
BE
DESPERATE
WE
KNOW
FROM
THE
RECORD
THAT
HE
WAS
ON
THE
WATER
SO
WHAT
WE
HAVE
TO
DOIS
TO
ASCERTAIN
WHAT
WATER
THE
FIRST
THING
IS
TO
REALISE
EXACTLY
WHAT
HE
HAS
DONE
AS
YET
WE
MAY
THEN
GET
A
LIGHT
ON
WHAT
HIS
LATER
TASK
IS
TO
BE
FIRSTLY
WE
MUST
DIFFERENTIATE
BETWEEN
WHAT
HE
DID
IN
LONDON
AS
PARTOF
HIS
GENERAL
PLAN
OF
ACTION
WHEN
HE
WAS
PRESSED
FOR
MOMENTS
AND
HADTO
ARRANGE
AS
BEST
HE
COULD
SECONDLY
WE
MUST
SEE
AS
WELL
AS
WE
CAN
SURMISE
IT
FROM
THE
FACTS
WEKNOW
OF
WHAT
HE
HAS
DONE
HERE
AS
TO
THE
FIRST

LEST
WE
SHOULD
ASCERTAIN
HIS

OFEXIT
FROM

HIS

THEN
WAS
TO

THE
PROOF
OF
THIS
IS
THE

BEFORE

THERE
ISALSO

PHENOMENALLY
QUICK
JOURNEY
SO
MUCH
SO
THAT
CAPTAIN

WERE
AROUSED
BUT
HIS

UNITED
WITH

THE

FOR

RAN
WITH

AND
ALL
TILL

OFF
AND
GAVE
IT
TO
SKINSKY
SKINSKY
TOOK
IT
AND
HEREWE
LOSE
THE
TRAIL
WE
ONLY
KNOW
THAT
THE
BOX
IS
SOMEWHERE
ON
THE

MOVING
ALONG
THE
CUSTOMS
AND
THE
OCTROI
IF
THERE
BE
ANY
HAVE
BEENAVOIDED
NOW
WE
COME
TO
WHAT
THE

MUST
HAVE
DONE
AFTER
HIS
ARRIVAL
ONLAND
AT
GALATZ
THE
BOX
WAS
GIVEN
TO
SKINSKY
BEFORE
SUNRISE
AT
SUNRISE
THE
COUNT
COULDAPPEAR
IN
HIS
OWN
FORM
HERE
WE
ASK
WHY
SKINSKY
WAS
CHOSEN
AT
ALL
TOAID
IN
THE
WORK
IN
MY
HUSBAND
S
DIARY
SKINSKY
IS
MENTIONED
AS
DEALINGWITH
THE
SLOVAKS
WHO
TRADE
DOWN
THE
RIVER
TO
THE
PORT
AND
THE
MAN
SREMARK
THAT
THE
MURDER
WAS
THE
WORK
OF
A
SLOVAK
SHOWED
THE
GENERALFEELING
AGAINST
HIS
CLASS
THE
COUNT
WANTED
ISOLATION
MY
SURMISE
IS
THIS
THAT
IN
LONDON
THE
COUNT
DECIDED
TO
GET
BACK
TO
HISCASTLE
BY
WATER
AS
THE
MOST
SAFE
AND
SECRET
WAY
HE
WAS
BROUGHT
FROMTHE
CASTLE
BY
SZGANY
AND
PROBABLY
THEY
DELIVERED
THEIR
CARGO
TO
SLOVAKSWHO
TOOK
THE
BOXES
TO
VARNA
FOR
THERE
THEY
WERE
SHIPPED
FOR
LONDON
THUS
THE
COUNT
HAD
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
PERSONS
WHO
COULD
ARRANGE
THISSERVICE
WHEN
THE
BOX
WAS
ON
LAND
BEFORE
SUNRISE
OR
AFTER
SUNSET
HECAME
OUT
FROM
HIS
BOX
MET
SKINSKY
AND
INSTRUCTED
HIM
WHAT
TO
DO
AS
TOARRANGING
THE
CARRIAGE
OF
THE
BOX
UP
SOME
RIVER
WHEN
THIS
WAS
DONE
ANDHE
KNEW
THAT
ALL
WAS
IN
TRAIN
HE
BLOTTED
OUT
HIS
TRACES
AS
HE
THOUGHT
BY
MURDERING
HIS
AGENT
I
HAVE
EXAMINED
THE
MAP
AND
FIND
THAT
THE
RIVER
MOST
SUITABLE
FOR
THESLOVAKS
TO
HAVE
ASCENDED
IS
EITHER
THE
PRUTH
OR
THE
SERETH
I
READ
INTHE
TYPESCRIPT
THAT
IN
MY
TRANCE
I
HEARD
COWS
LOW
AND
WATER
SWIRLINGLEVEL
WITH
MY
EARS
AND
THE
CREAKING
OF
WOOD
THE
COUNT
IN
HIS
BOX
THEN
WAS
ON
A
RIVER
IN
AN
OPEN
BOAT
PROPELLED
PROBABLY
EITHER
BY
OARS
ORPOLES
FOR
THE
BANKS
ARE
NEAR
AND
IT
IS
WORKING
AGAINST
STREAM
THEREWOULD
BE
NO
SUCH
SOUND
IF
FLOATING
DOWN
STREAM
OF
COURSE
IT
MAY
NOT
BE
EITHER
THE
SERETH
OR
THE
PRUTH
BUT
WE
MAYPOSSIBLY
INVESTIGATE
FURTHER
NOW
OF
THESE
TWO
THE
PRUTH
IS
THE
MOREEASILY
NAVIGATED
BUT
THE
SERETH
IS
AT

JOINED
BY
THE
BISTRITZAWHICH

WE
GOT
AROUMANIAN
FLAG
WHICH
WE
NOW
FLY
CONSPICUOUSLY
WITH
EVERY
BOAT
WHICH
WEHAVE
OVER
HAULED
SINCE
THEN
THIS
TRICK
HAS
SUCCEEDED
WE
HAVE
HAD
EVERYDEFERENCE
SHOWN
TO
US
AND
NOT
ONCE
ANY
OBJECTION
TO
WHATEVER
WE
CHOSETO
ASK
OR
DO
SOME
OF
THE
SLOVAKS
TELL
US
THAT
A
BIG
BOAT
PASSED
THEM
GOING
AT
MORE
THAN
USUAL
SPEED
AS
SHE
HAD
A
DOUBLE
CREW
ON
BOARD
THISWAS
BEFORE
THEY
CAME
TO
FUNDU
SO
THEY
COULD
NOT
TELL
US
WHETHER
THEBOAT
TURNED
INTO
THE
BISTRITZA
OR
CONTINUED
ON
UP
THE
SERETH
AT
FUNDUWE
COULD
NOT
HEAR
OF
ANY
SUCH
BOAT
SO
SHE
MUST
HAVE
PASSED
THERE
IN
THENIGHT
I
AM
FEELING
VERY
SLEEPY
THE
COLD
IS
PERHAPS
BEGINNING
TO
TELLUPON
ME
AND
NATURE
MUST
HAVE
REST
SOME

INSISTS
THAT
HESHALL
KEEP
THE
FIRST
WATCH
GOD
BLESS
HIM
FOR
ALL
HIS
GOODNESS
TO
POORDEAR
MINA
AND
ME
NOVEMBER
MORNING
IT
IS
BROAD
DAYLIGHT
THAT
GOOD

WOULD
NOTWAKE
ME
HE
SAYS
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
A
SIN
TO
FOR
I
SLEPT
PEACEFULLY
ANDWAS
FORGETTING
MY
TROUBLE
IT
SEEMS
BRUTALLY
SELFISH
TO
ME
TO
HAVE
SLEPTSO
LONG
AND
LET
HIM
WATCH
ALL
NIGHT
BUT
HE
WAS
QUITE
RIGHT
I
AM
A
NEWMAN
THIS
MORNING
AND
AS
I
SIT
HERE
AND
WATCH
HIM
SLEEPING
I
CAN
DOALL
THAT
IS
NECESSARY
BOTH
AS
TO
MINDING
THE
ENGINE
STEERING
ANDKEEPING

I
CAN
FEEL
THAT
MY
STRENGTH
AND
ENERGY
ARE
COMING
BACK

I
WONDER
WHERE

NOW
AND
VAN
HELSING
THEY

HAVE
GOT
TOVERESTI
ABOUT
NOON
ON
WEDNESDAY
IT
WOULD
TAKE
THEM
SOME
TIME
TO

SO
IF

AND
TRAVELLED
HARD
THEYWOULD
BE
ABOUT
NOW
AT
THE
BORGO
PASS
GOD
GUIDE
AND
HELP
THEM
I
AMAFRAID
TO
THINK
WHAT
MAY

IF

HOW

TOSEE
IT

IF

WE
HAVE

AT

SEEM
TO
KNOW
THAT
THEY
ARE
BEING
KINDLY
TREATED
FOR
THEY
GOWILLINGLY
THEIR
FULL
STAGE
AT

WE
HAVE
NOW
HAD
SO
MANYCHANGES
AND
FIND
THE
SAME
THING
SO
CONSTANTLY
THAT
WE
ARE
ENCOURAGED
TOTHINK
THAT
THE
JOURNEY
WILL
BE
AN
EASY
ONE
DR
VAN
HELSING
IS
LACONIC
HE
TELLS
THE
FARMERS
THAT
HE
IS
HURRYING
TO
BISTRITZ
AND
PAYS
THEM
WELLTO
MAKE
THE
EXCHANGE
OF
HORSES
WE
GET
HOT
SOUP
OR
COFFEE
OR
TEA
ANDOFF
WE
GO
IT
IS
A
LOVELY
COUNTRY
FULL
OF
BEAUTIES
OF
ALL
IMAGINABLEKINDS
AND
THE
PEOPLE
ARE
BRAVE
AND
STRONG
AND
SIMPLE
AND
SEEM
FULLOF
NICE
QUALITIES
THEY
ARE
VERY
VERY
SUPERSTITIOUS
IN
THE
FIRSTHOUSE
WHERE
WE
STOPPED
WHEN
THE
WOMAN
WHO
SERVED
US
SAW
THE
SCAR
ON
MYFOREHEAD
SHE
CROSSED
HERSELF
AND
PUT
OUT
TWO
FINGERS
TOWARDS
ME
TOKEEP
OFF
THE
EVIL
EYE
I
BELIEVE
THEY
WENT
TO
THE
TROUBLE
OF
PUTTING
ANEXTRA
AMOUNT
OF
GARLIC
INTO
OUR
FOOD
AND
I
CAN
T
ABIDE
GARLIC
EVERSINCE
THEN
I
HAVE
TAKEN
CARE
NOT
TO
TAKE
OFF
MY
HAT
OR
VEIL
AND
SO
HAVEESCAPED
THEIR
SUSPICIONS
WE
ARE
TRAVELLING
FAST
AND
AS
WE
HAVE
NODRIVER
WITH
US
TO
CARRY
TALES
WE
GO
AHEAD
OF
SCANDAL
BUT
I
DARESAYTHAT
FEAR
OF
THE
EVIL
EYE
WILL
FOLLOW
HARD
BEHIND
US
ALL
THE
WAY
THEPROFESSOR
SEEMS
TIRELESS
ALL
DAY
HE
WOULD
NOT
TAKE
ANY
REST
THOUGH
HEMADE
ME
SLEEP
FOR
A
LONG
SPELL
AT
SUNSET
TIME
HE
HYPNOTISED
ME
AND
HESAYS
THAT
I
ANSWERED
AS
USUAL
DARKNESS
LAPPING
WATER
AND
CREAKINGWOOD
SO
OUR
ENEMY
IS
STILL
ON
THE
RIVER
I
AM
AFRAID
TO
THINK
OFJONATHAN
BUT
SOMEHOW
I
HAVE
NOW
NO
FEAR
FOR

OR
FOR

WHILST

WHEN

WHILST

I

AT

DO
HOPE
THAT

ADD
HAVE

I
THINK
SOMEWHAT
STRANGE
BUT
SOON
I
SEE
THAT
THERE
BE
ONLY
ONESUCH
BY

IT
IS
USED
BUT
LITTLE
AND
VERY
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
COACHROAD
FROM
THE
BUKOVINA
TO
BISTRITZ
WHICH
IS
MORE
WIDE
AND
HARD
ANDMORE
OF
USE
SO
WE
CAME
DOWN

NOT

FOR

ANDPALE
AND
WEAK
BUT
HER
EYES
WERE
PURE
AND
GLOWED
WITH
FERVOUR
I
WASGLAD
TO
SEE
HER
PALENESS
AND
HER
ILLNESS
FOR
MY
MIND
WAS
FULL
OF
THEFRESH
HORROR
OF
THAT
RUDDY

AND
SO
WITH

AND

FULL
OF

THAT

MINA
HARKER
S
JOURNAL
NOVEMBER
IT
WAS
LATE
IN
THE
AFTERNOON
WHEN
THE
PROFESSOR
AND
ITOOK
OUR
WAY
TOWARDS
THE
EAST
WHENCE
I
KNEW
JONATHAN
WAS
COMING
WE
DIDNOT
GO
FAST
THOUGH
THE
WAY
WAS
STEEPLY
DOWNHILL
FOR
WE
HAD
TO
TAKEHEAVY
RUGS
AND
WRAPS
WITH
US
WE
DARED
NOT
FACE
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
BEINGLEFT
WITHOUT
WARMTH
IN
THE
COLD
AND
THE
SNOW
WE
HAD
TO
TAKE
SOME
OF
OURPROVISIONS
TOO
FOR
WE
WERE
IN
A
PERFECT
DESOLATION
AND
SO
FAR
AS
WECOULD
SEE
THROUGH
THE
SNOWFALL
THERE
WAS
NOT
EVEN
THE
SIGN
OFHABITATION
WHEN
WE
HAD
GONE
ABOUT
A
MILE
I
WAS
TIRED
WITH
THE
HEAVYWALKING
AND
SAT
DOWN
TO
REST
THEN
WE
LOOKED
BACK
AND
SAW
WHERE
THECLEAR
LINE
OF
DRACULA
S
CASTLE
CUT
THE
SKY
FOR
WE
WERE
SO
DEEP
UNDERTHE
HILL
WHEREON
IT
WAS
SET
THAT
THE
ANGLE
OF
PERSPECTIVE
OF
THECARPATHIAN
MOUNTAINS
WAS
FAR
BELOW
IT
WE
SAW
IT
IN
ALL
ITS
GRANDEUR
PERCHED
A
THOUSAND
FEET
ON
THE
SUMMIT
OF
A
SHEER
PRECIPICE
AND
WITHSEEMINGLY
A
GREAT
GAP
BETWEEN
IT
AND
THE
STEEP
OF
THE
ADJACENT
MOUNTAINON
ANY
SIDE
THERE
WAS
SOMETHING
WILD
AND
UNCANNY
ABOUT
THE
PLACE
WECOULD
HEAR
THE
DISTANT
HOWLING
OF
WOLVES
THEY
WERE
FAR
OFF
BUT
THESOUND
EVEN
THOUGH
COMING
MUFFLED
THROUGH
THE
DEADENING
SNOWFALL
WASFULL
OF
TERROR
I
KNEW
FROM
THE
WAY
DR
VAN
HELSING
WAS
SEARCHING
ABOUTTHAT
HE
WAS
TRYING
TO
SEEK
SOME
STRATEGIC
POINT
WHERE
WE
WOULD
BE
LESSEXPOSED
IN
CASE
OF
ATTACK
THE
ROUGH
ROADWAY
STILL
LED
DOWNWARDS
WECOULD
TRACE
IT
THROUGH
THE
DRIFTED
SNOW
IN
A
LITTLE
WHILE
THE
PROFESSOR
SIGNALLED
TO
ME
SO
I
GOT
UP
AND
JOINEDHIM
HE
HAD
FOUND
A
WONDERFUL
SPOT
A
SORT
OF
NATURAL
HOLLOW
IN
A
ROCK
WITH
AN
ENTRANCE
LIKE
A
DOORWAY
BETWEEN
TWO
BOULDERS
HE
TOOK
ME
BY
THEHAND
AND
DREW
ME
IN
SEE
HE
SAID
HERE
YOU
WILL
BE
IN
SHELTER
ANDIF
THE
WOLVES
DO
COME
I
CAN
MEET
THEM
ONE
BY
ONE
HE
BROUGHT
IN
OURFURS
AND
MADE
A
SNUG
NEST
FOR
ME
AND
GOT
OUT
SOME
PROVISIONS
ANDFORCED
THEM
UPON
ME
BUT
I
COULD
NOT
EAT
TO
EVEN
TRY
TO
DO
SO
WASREPULSIVE
TO
ME
AND
MUCH
AS
I
WOULD
HAVE
LIKED
TO
PLEASE
HIM
I
COULDNOT
BRING
MYSELF
TO
THE
ATTEMPT
HE
LOOKED
VERY
SAD
BUT
DID
NOTREPROACH
ME
TAKING
HIS
FIELD
GLASSES
FROM
THE
CASE
HE
STOOD
ON
THE
TOPOF
THE
ROCK
AND
BEGAN
TO
SEARCH
THE
HORIZON
SUDDENLY
HE
CALLED
OUT
LOOK
MADAM
MINA
LOOK
LOOK
I
SPRANG
UP
AND
STOOD
BESIDE
HIM
ON
THEROCK
HE
HANDED
ME
HIS
GLASSES
AND
POINTED
THE
SNOW
WAS
NOW
FALLINGMORE
HEAVILY
AND
SWIRLED
ABOUT
FIERCELY
FOR
A
HIGH
WIND
WAS
BEGINNINGTO
BLOW
HOWEVER
THERE
WERE
TIMES
WHEN
THERE
WERE
PAUSES
BETWEEN
THESNOW
FLURRIES
AND
I
COULD
SEE
A
LONG
WAY
ROUND
FROM
THE
HEIGHT
WHERE
WEWERE
IT
WAS
POSSIBLE
TO
SEE
A
GREAT
DISTANCE
AND
FAR
OFF
BEYOND
THEWHITE
WASTE
OF
SNOW
I
COULD
SEE
THE
RIVER
LYING
LIKE
A
BLACK
RIBBON
INKINKS
AND
CURLS
AS
IT
WOUND
ITS
WAY
STRAIGHT
IN
FRONT
OF
US
AND
NOT
FAROFF
IN
FACT
SO
NEAR
THAT
I
WONDERED
WE
HAD
NOT
NOTICED
BEFORE
CAME
AGROUP
OF
MOUNTED
MEN
HURRYING
ALONG
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
THEM
WAS
A
CART
ALONG
LEITER
WAGON
WHICH
SWEPT
FROM
SIDE
TO
SIDE
LIKE
A
DOG
S
TAILWAGGING
WITH
EACH
STERN
INEQUALITY
OF
THE
ROAD
OUTLINED
AGAINST
THESNOW
AS
THEY
WERE
I
COULD
SEE
FROM
THE
MEN
S
CLOTHES
THAT
THEY
WEREPEASANTS
OR
GYPSIES
OF
SOME
KIND
ON
THE
CART
WAS
A
GREAT
SQUARE
CHEST
MY
HEART
LEAPED
AS
I
SAW
IT
FOR
IFELT
THAT
THE
END
WAS
COMING
THE
EVENING
WAS
NOW
DRAWING
CLOSE
ANDWELL
I
KNEW
THAT
AT
SUNSET
THE
THING
WHICH
WAS
TILL
THEN
IMPRISONEDTHERE
WOULD
TAKE
NEW
FREEDOM
AND
COULD
IN
ANY
OF
MANY
FORMS
ELUDE
ALLPURSUIT
IN
FEAR
I
TURNED
TO
THE
PROFESSOR
TO
MY
CONSTERNATION
HOWEVER
HE
WAS
NOT
THERE
AN
INSTANT
LATER
I
SAW
HIM
BELOW
ME
ROUNDTHE
ROCK
HE
HAD
DRAWN
A
CIRCLE
SUCH
AS
WE
HAD
FOUND
SHELTER
IN
LASTNIGHT
WHEN
HE
HAD
COMPLETED
IT
HE
STOOD
BESIDE
ME
AGAIN
SAYING
AT
LEAST
YOU
SHALL
BE
SAFE
HERE
FROM
HIM
HE
TOOK
THE
GLASSES
FROMME
AND
AT
THE
NEXT
LULL
OF
THE
SNOW
SWEPT
THE
WHOLE
SPACE
BELOW
US
SEE
HE
SAID
THEY
COME
QUICKLY
THEY
ARE
FLOGGING
THE
HORSES
ANDGALLOPING
AS
HARD
AS
THEY
CAN
HE
PAUSED
AND
WENT
ON
IN
A
HOLLOWVOICE
THEY
ARE
RACING
FOR
THE
SUNSET
WE
MAY
BE
TOO
LATE
GOD

BEDONE
DOWN

ANOTHER
BLINDING
RUSH
OF

AND
THE
WHOLELANDSCAPE
WAS
BLOTTED
OUT
IT
SOON
PASSED
HOWEVER
AND
ONCE
MORE
HISGLASSES
WERE
FIXED
ON

CAME
A
SUDDEN
CRY

UP
FROM

IT
MUST
BE
QUINCEY
AND
JOHN

IT
ALL
OUT
I
TOOK
IT
AND
LOOKED

MR

I
KNEW
AT
ALL
EVENTS
THAT
NEITHER
OF

AT
THE

TIME
I
KNEW
THAT
JONATHAN
WAS
NOT
FAR
OFF

AROUNDI
SAW
ON
THE

OF
THE

PARTY
TWO
OTHER

RIDING
ATBREAK

ONE
OF
THEM
I
KNEW

AND
CLOSER
WHEN
THE

A
MOMENT
WE
LOOKED

WAS
STRANGE
TO

IN
SUCH
HEAVY
FLAKES
CLOSE
TO

AND
BEYOND
THE

SHINING
MORE
AND

AND
THE

WITH
FURY
AS

SWEPT
UPON

INCIRCLING

AT

WE
COULD
NOT

BUT
AT
